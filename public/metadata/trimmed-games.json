This comic came out during the explosion of the medium in the early 90s, and I have to admit that I was not into it at all.\nValentino, seeing the success of the 16-bit era consoles and a crossover with Shadowhawk's main audience, apparently decided to finance the creation of a video game. However, it never saw the light of day, much like other games based on lesser known comics, such as Prime and Firearm.\nThe game is split into two modes. It featured one or two platforming stages, followed by a Mortal Kombat-style boss fight.

It features Ushio Aotsuki, a young man who discovers the powerful Beast Spear that his ancestor used to trap a vicious youkai monster called Tora (Japanese for \"tiger\"). Recovering the spear causes not only Tora to be free, but draws many other evil youkai out from hiding. Tora works begrudgingly with Ushio to fight back the wave of youkai out of fear of the spear's power (though as the manga progresses, Tora's reasons for helping become more altruistic).\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling brawler with short stages that culminate in boss fights with other youkai, similar to the Super Famicom GeGeGe no Kitarou game. The player can choose between Ushio and Tora to control, and each controls slightly differently: Ushio has greater range with the spear and can create shockwaves, while Tora is a powerhouse up close with his claws and can summon bolts of lightning.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"14808","CommunityRating":"3.5","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Yutaka","Publisher":"Bandai"},{"Name":"Barbie: Super Model","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Nobody said becoming a world famous Super Model would be easy.

One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...\n\nThe game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a \"world map\": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"19069","CommunityRating":"2.875","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Dragon","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Alfa System","Publisher":"Media Works"},{"Name":"Plok","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Plok is a side-scrolling platform game developed by Software Creations and released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. The game is a traditional platform game starring a character named Plok.\n\nPlok can launch any of his limbs at will to damage enemies. Once the damage has been done they return to Plok. Some puzzles involve having to \"sacrifice\" one of Plok's limbs to activate switches (thus gradually decreasing Plok's mobility and his chances in battle). Once a limb hits a switch, it is placed on a hanger that may be right next to the switch or several screens away; some switches also require certain limbs. Plok's secondary attack takes the form of a buzzsaw-like jump that not only gives him increased speed, but also dispatches enemies. Plok can pick up shells, which award extra lives and serve as ammunition for a special amulet received partway through the game. The amulet converts shells into power for Plok's secondary attack.\nPower-ups come in the form of \"presents\" scattered throughout the majority of levels. If Plok locates one of these colorful gifts he is immediately transformed into a more powerful fighting machine for a brief length of time. These power-ups include a flamethrower, boxing gloves, a blunderbuss, dueling pistols and multiple rocket launchers. Specific presents yield vehicles that Plok can use in some later levels in the fleas' lair such as a unicycle, Jeep, jetpack, motorbike, tank, helicopter, Flying saucer and a pair of spring pogo shoes.\nThe player encounters a number of different enemies, such as the aforementioned fleas.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSalAo_rIM0","DatabaseID":"5784","CommunityRating":"3.7708333333333335","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plok","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"24","Genres":"Action; Platform","Developer":"Software Creations Ltd.","Publisher":"Tradewest"},{"Name":"Kaite Tsukutte Asoberu: Dezaemon","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Japan-only shooter construction kit for the Super Famicom system.

It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!\n\nThe game's main claim to fame is its intro theme, which incorporates a vocal track. Normally, such a track cannot be done on the SNES, as all assets for a single song must fit into the 64kB audio buffer before the song can be played. This technical limit was overcome by slicing the vocal track into small samples and swapping them in and out of the audio buffer. The rest of the intro theme is standard MIDI.\n\n\"Tales of Phantasia\" presents a unique combat system. The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQNghU4xGIU","DatabaseID":"6232","CommunityRating":"4.3409090909090908","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Phantasia","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"22","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Namco"},{"Name":"Fire Emblem: Thracia 776","ReleaseDate":"1999-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 is a Japanese tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo, and the fifth installment in the Fire Emblem series.

The hero begins the game in a state of total memory-loss, but discovers that he has somehow acquired a mysterious power that shields him from all bodily harm, essentially making him immortal. The only clue the hero has in discovering his own identity is a mysterious dream that he sees every night, and he begins his journey in search of the location shown in the dream.\n\nThe gameplay borrows various motifs from ancient mythology, particularly the concept of immortality. An immortal character can execute certain actions that other characters cannot, like jumping off high cliffs without being injured. The game's writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a storyline where the hero encounters the Greek gods while trying to discover his own true identity.

A rom of what appears to be the complete version of this game exists. The enemies and gameplay closely match Turrican, as to be expected. It is unknown why this game was canceled. Genesis and Game Boy versions of this game were released, and Turrican 2 was released on various computer platforms. Nintendo Power commented in the October 1992 issue that it was similar to Contra, but complained about the poor controls.\nThe game was originally developed using the original C64 source code and Amiga graphics as a base. At a late stage in the development, Accolade also acquired rights to produce a game spin-off of the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Universal Soldier and decided to rebrand the game as Universal Soldier. Turrican's sprite was changed into a marine and several other substitutions were made. Amongst other changes, the eyeballs-walking-on-fingers became mini tanks, and instead of a large mech/steel dragon in the first stage, the player now faces a large representation of Dolph Lundgren's character in the film.\nThe three shoot 'em up stages, cut out from the port, were replaced by the developers with three original stages (a Vietnam jungle, a fortress, and a motel/car junkyard) that in theory should link the game to the film's atmosphere. The rest of the original Turrican II stages are still present and remain mostly intact in overall design, though some of them appear in different order, along with the three new levels differently scattered through them.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"113075","CommunityRating":"3.5166666666666666","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"30","Genres":"Action","Developer":"The Code Monkeys","Publisher":"Accolade"},{"Name":"Panic in Nakayoshi World","ReleaseDate":"1994-11-18T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"This title is about monsters that are attacking the World of Nakayoshi.

The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play. Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:\n\nStar Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the score.\n\nFriend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.\n\nBomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row.\n\nHard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.\n\nThe game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks. If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"19031","CommunityRating":"3.3888888888888888","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Star_Stacker","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"9","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Publisher":"Nintendo"},{"Name":"Super Keiba 2","ReleaseDate":"1995-05-19T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Super Keiba 2 is a horseracing sim from Tomcat and I'Max and the sequel to their 1993 Super Keiba.

In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed \"Berserkers\". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.\n\nCyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.\n\nCombat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \"options\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3545","CommunityRating":"3","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Advance Communication Company","Publisher":"Tonkinhouse"},{"Name":"Super International Cricket","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"From the crack of the cricket bat to cheering crowds, this game has it all - even seagulls!

The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...\n\nGun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3624","CommunityRating":"3.9705882352941178","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Mission_Series:_Gun_Hazard","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"17","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Shooter","Developer":"Squaresoft","Publisher":"Squaresoft"},{"Name":"Pinocchio","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"For the first time in an interactive game, you discover the meanings of truth, bravery and unselfishness in a whole new way.

It eventually was retooled and released on various 32 bit platforms as Grid Runner. A prototype rom has been dumped.\n\nEurit is an action game that was being developed by Radical. The game is basically a souped up version of childhood games of Tag and Capture the Flag. The game features a split-screen and is an ideal two player game. A near complete beta of this game was discovered, and it is probably one of the best unreleased games for the snes.\n\nThe story behind the game is that the ruler of the galaxy decides that he will retire. In order to find a suitable replacement, he sets up a tournament where wizards and warriors compete to determine who shall be ruler. Throughout the game, you travel to many worlds across the galaxy to prove your might.\n\nThere are four characters to chose from at the start of the game. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, based on their speed, spellcasting agility, and magic capacity. Through my playthrough, I used the average character.\n\nThe gameplay is very addictive, and relatively easy to get into. Basically, one of the characters starts off being \"it\". The person who is it cannot capture flags, so they must chase down the other character and touch them. Once you are not it, you can collect flags necessary to win the stage.\n\nComplicating the game is the obstacles you face. To proceed through the level, you basically have to build platforms. There are many levels with enemy creatures that usually require a number of blasts with your gun to kill. Speed tiles send you running really quickly, which can either make you quickly escape your foe, or send you far away from him.\n\nProbably the most compelling gameplay feature for experts is the magic system. Before each level, you learn a new magic spell. Some spells are mundane, like destroying a platform, but others can devistate your opponent, like the spell that causes all the creatures in the level to attack your opponent. Powerup balls throughout the level allow you to charge your magic meter.\n\nThe music is pretty typical \"sci-fi game\" fare, comparible to games like Blackthorne, B.O.B., and The Lost Vikings. The sound effects are somewhat muted, though the voice that tells you \"player 1 is now it\" is really well done. The graphics aren't anything too special, but they do the job.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"122730","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Radical Entertaiment"},{"Name":"True Golf Classics: Wicked 18","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Can You Take The Ultimate Test?

Still, on 18 December 1940, Hitler authorized an invasion of the Soviet Union for a start date of 15 May 1941, but this was not met; instead, the invasion began on 22 June 1941. Over the course of the operation, about four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union along a 2,900-kilometer (1,800 mi) front, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare. In addition to troops, the Germans employed some 600,000 motor vehicles and between 600–700,000 horses.

It is based on the international level of ice hockey with teams from 1994 as opposed to domestic (intra-national) ice hockey leagues.\n\nThere are several gameplay modes that can be chosen from the main menu of the game. These include exhibition mode, playoff mode, and an Olympic mode that is loosely based on the 1994 Winter Olympics. The object of the Olympic mode is to simply win the gold medal while the defeated team receives a silver medal. In order to qualify for the gold medal game, he or she must rank in the top four in either \"League A\" or \"League B\" during the round-robin format; an X refers to a win while an O refers to a defeat. Achieving this will promote the player's team to a playoff of eight teams that will determine the gold and silver medal recipients. Teams that belong to opposite leagues eventually get to play against each other in the playoff mode.\n\nPeriods can either last for one minute, two minutes (60 seconds) or three minutes long (120 seconds). Referees can be set to either real (similar to real international hockey), normal (similar to the NHL), or free (involving a visually challenged referee who only calls for icing). In the real mode, penalties are given for every body check while most body checking is allowed in normal. However, both participants that are involved in a fighting situation are penalized in both normal and real mode. This is offset by using extremely short durations in the penalty box due to the unrealistically low period durations.","MaxPlayers":"4","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"122624","CommunityRating":"3","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Ice_Hockey","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"20","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Opera House","Publisher":"Sunsoft"},{"Name":"Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou!

Japan, controlled by the feudal rulers (shoguns) of the Tokugawa dynasty, consumed by a peaceful sleep for three hundred years, was awoken by the arrival of the Westerners. It seemed that they only wanted the end of Japan's isolation from the rest of the world. But their true purpose was to take control of a mysterious Japanese energy source called reiketsu. To protect those sources, that were running dry during their three hundred years-long reign, the Tokugawa Shoguns formed the famous Shinsengumi special force. In addition to its primary mission of clearing out forces that would try to overthrow the shogunate, there also existed a special branch of them called \"Shadow Shinsengumi\". The duty of the \"Shadow\" was to take care of \"those things the human hand cannot manage\"...\n\nYou control Yamatomaru, a strong-willed sixteen-year-old boy who lives in Iida village, near Koufu. His father has recently passed away. After failing to defeat a monster in his village, he was saved by one of the Shadow Shinsengumi man, Mibu Juurota. As he receives his father's katana, he goes on his first mission - rescuing boys who were trapped in a mountain path. Soon the plot thickens and the young hero becomes involved in mystical struggles between the forces who try to control reiketsu...\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Dragon Quest series and other Japanese-style RPGs: the battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. You fight using physical attacks and a variety of special moves based on spiritual energy. An unusual addition to the gameplay is the karma system. By doing good deeds you can increase your karma level, in an Ultima-like way. This way you get more money and precious items from fighting monsters, and your special powers increase in strength. If you don't show compassion, steal people's things and lie, your karma will decrease, you won't get money from random battles, and some people will attack you.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"33886","CommunityRating":"1.3636363636363635","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"11","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Pandora Box","Publisher":"Banpresto"},{"Name":"Harley's Humongous Adventure","ReleaseDate":"1993-02-05T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"HARLEY is a cool young genius whose biggest experiment just backfired in a most heinous way.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\n\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\n\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\n\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"9054","CommunityRating":"3.65","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamut_Lagoon","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"20","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Squaresoft","Publisher":"Squaresoft"},{"Name":"Lord Monarch","ReleaseDate":"1992-10-09T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Lord Monarch is an RTS game in which the player assumes one side of a conflict and must overpower the other sides using tactics and diplomacy. The player can establish alliances with other computer sides in order to get an edge, though this alliance dissolves as soon as the player attacks that particular CPU side. The player must conquer the entire map within a strict time limit, often making these temporary alliances a necessity. The player is represented on the map as a special leader character, who acts like leader characters from strategy games like Fire Emblem in that they are generally stronger than most of their regular units, can perform special tasks unique to them and the game will end if they are defeated.\n\nThe game is the seventh main entry of the Dragon Slayer franchise. Like Sorcerian before it, the name \"Dragon Slayer\" is not included in the title.\n\nIn the enhanced Super Famicom version, the player can switch the theme from generic medieval fantasy to a whole selection of other settings such as futuristic sci-fi, the Three Kingdoms Era of Ancient China, a fairytale theme and even a setting that re-imagines the game as a territory war between competing fast food chains. This Super Famicom version was one of a handful of games to support the SNES Mouse peripheral.

A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.\n\nYour spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.\n\nPlay takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core.

A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.\n\nEach party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.\n\nThe map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.\n\nIn some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3606","CommunityRating":"2.9","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"5","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Max Entertainment","Publisher":"Yanoman"},{"Name":"SD Ultra Battle: Ultraman Densetsu","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"SD Ultra Battle: Ultraman Densetsu is an Action game, developed by Tom Create and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1996.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"126638","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Tom Create","Publisher":"Bandai"},{"Name":"Shin Megami Tensei II","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-18T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"The gameplay comprises first-person exploration of dungeons and battles against demons; the player can also choose to speak to the demons, and attempt to recruit them to their party.

So when Downtown was mysteriously overrun with colored blocks, he was the obvious choice to get to the bottom of the situation. Armed with his trusty jackhammer, he begins his descent toward the Earth's core.\n\nOur hero can drill up, down, left and right. Drilling through single blocks would take forever, so it's fortunate that blocks of the same color form into groups that vanish when only one of the blocks is drilled. This allows for chain reactions, since vanishing blocks will often cause other blocks to fall and form new groups. Alas, these falling blocks are also deadly if they hit Mr. Driller.\n\nIf all Mr. Driller had to do was drill, life would be easy. But he also has to keep refilling his oxygen supply by collecting air capsules scattered throughout the blocks. The deeper he goes, the faster his air runs out. Hampering his progress even further are brown \"X-blocks\" that take five drill strikes to disappear and remove 20% of Mr. Driller's air when broken.\n\nThe Arcade game consists of two courses: Easy (2,500 feet) and Hard (5,000 feet). A course is completed when Mr. Driller reaches the target depth. Bonus points are awarded if the course is finished in record time or if Mr. Driller has lives to spare (30,000 per life). Each single block is worth ten points; groups of four or more earn 40 points per block; and air capsules earn points on an increasing scale: 100 for the first, 200 for the second, 300 for the third, etc.\n\nThe PlayStation version features two additional modes: Survival and Time Attack. In Survival mode, Mr. Driller must drill as deep as he can using only one life. He can begin at the surface, 5,000 feet or 10,000 feet. In Time Attack, Mr. Driller must drill through a predetermined course and beat the record time. Instead of air capsules, he collects clocks to decrease the timer. Initially, there are only four available courses, but more are unlocked when those are completed.\n\nFeatures:\n* Quickly drill through colored blocks before your air supply runs out\n* Features three play modes: Arcade, Time Attack, and Survival\n* Save progress and high scores to memory card","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVs16qsxpSU","DatabaseID":"17378","CommunityRating":"2.7142857142857144","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco"},{"Name":"Gekitotsu Toma L'Arc: Tomarunner Vs L'Arc En Ciel","ReleaseDate":"2000-07-19T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Tomarunner is a foot-racing game where your opponents include a robot, a kappa, an angel, a masked roller-skater, and a boy with Big Boy hair. You run around a variety of tracks including mines, buddhist temples, busy streets, hotels, beaches, and castles, busily shoving your enemies out of the way while bouncing off the walls and flinging yourself around with vertical and horizontal bars and flying through people's living rooms all in the name of finding a shortcut.\n\nWeapons include heat seaking missiles, mines, and super-bouncy balls. Various items on the track include speed boosts, lightning (to smite thine enemy), bombs, and protective baby chicks. It's really fast, it's really fun, and it will deeply disturb your friends.\n\nThis game is a fun and humorous character racing game which involves the original cast of TomaRunner and all four members of the band, L'Arc~en~Ciel (Hyde-vocals, Tetsu-bass, Ken-guitar, and Yukihiro-drums).\n\nTomal'Arc falls into the racing category, but like its predecessor, it is not the standard car-racing kind. Instead, the racers run about the track on foot (and sometimes on face), avoiding obstacles, swinging on poles, bouncing off walls, and flinging fruit! * Sounds fun already, doesn't it?\n\nThe gameplay has a bit of a learning curve, especially for impulsive types who don't bother to read the manual beforehand, but after a little practice, it's quite easy to play. Instead of just steering and accelarating, characters will run automatically while the player in charge controls weapons, dashing, and the all-important hands. It's pretty different from any other racing game I've played. There are various items to pick up, so it's not simply about seeing who makes it to the finish line first.\n\nGame modes:\n- The normal match involves picking up crystals which determine how many people will attend the concert at the end of the game.\n- A more challenging version removes the crystals and also limits the number of stat-boosting items available, so the racers must compete on pure ability.\n- A third mode involves simply cheering on the band member of your choice as he races alone.\n\nEach member lent his own voice to his character, so we fans have the pleasure of hearing them speak as we play!","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"28386","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"SCEI","Publisher":"SCEI"},{"Name":"Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy","ReleaseDate":"1999-03-31T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Hello Kitty makes her way on to the PlayStation with Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy.

The game is notable for its bright colors, upbeat songs, and cute character graphics. Although Pop'n Music was originally intended to be played by couples on dates, it has greatly escalated in difficulty since early iterations, and has since then attracted many players of beatmania and other Bemani games. Originally released in 1998, the game has had 15 home releases in Japan as well as many arcade versions.\n\nPop'n Music and Pop'n Music 2 were released on the PlayStation and the Dreamcast, and for both consoles two further append discs were released: Pop'n Music 3 and Pop'n Music 4. These later two versions required a \"key disc\", i.e. one had to already possess Pop'n Music 2. A special controller featuring the nine colored buttons of the arcade version of the game was released for both consoles.\n\nPop'n Music 5, Pop'n Music 6, Pop'n Music Animation Melody and Pop'n Music Disney Tunes were then released for the PlayStation, but there were no further releases on the Dreamcast. Pop'n Music 5 and 6 could be used as \"key discs\" to play the append discs mentioned above.\n\nUnlike most of the Bemani series, the Pop'n Music controller is not designed to represent any real musical instrument. Instead it is a pattern of nine buttons in two rows; four on top and five on the bottom. On the screen colored notes called pop-kun fall from the top to the bottom in nine rows corresponding to the buttons. When the notes reach the bottom the player presses the button and the game emits a note of the song, along with a judgement ranging from Great (hit the note perfectly on beat) (or Cool in expert mode.) to Bad (missed the note completely and breaks a combo).\n\nLike beatmania, there is a life bar with a long green section on the left and a short red section on the right. Getting Greats (Or Cool in Expert) raises the lifebar, while getting Bad lowers it. When it is completely full, a higher rating called 'Fever' replaces 'Great' until the lifebar drops again. A song is passed if the life bar is in the red section at the end, which lets the player play another song. If the song is failed, the game may give the player another chance of playing the game, but used up the first life. (Player can insert the credits during the time limit. This happened until Pop'n Music 13, where the use of second chance is free. Although the limit of lives is 2. But it does not give effect at Cho-Challenge, Expert, Osusume or Net-Taisen Mode. (or in the 2nd or final stage)) If the player fails the second time, the game ends. A player may play a maximum of 3 songs (4 songs in Expert Mode.) before the game is over. 100,000 points is the maximum amount of points that can be earned per song, and denotes getting all Greats (or Cools in Expert).\n\nPop'n Music is differentiated from beatmania by its lack of a turntable and by its hand-size buttons. Where beatmania is played by pressing buttons with one's fingers, Pop'n Music is played by hitting buttons with one's palms, fingers, and in some situations, arms and elbows.\n\nPlayers can choose from a 5-key mode (disabling the leftmost and rightmost buttons), or a 9-key mode. Older console versions also included 7-key mode, which made it easy to fully use a beatmania IIDX controller.\n\nTo make the gameplay more interesting, higher difficulty levels feature obstacles known as \"Ojamas\", large sprites which obscure the player's view of the descending pop-kuns.\n\nStarting at PM 5, Challenge mode, usually called \"standard\" mode allows the players to choose the normas or Optional objective that uses to boost the challenge points and it also uses by e-amusement after PM 14.\n\nA mode that was featured in Pop'n Music 6 is Expert or Nonstop mode, where the player chooses from different song lists or courses and plays through them in either Normal or Hyper mode. The lifebar is different in this mode. The life bar starts full, and then lowers every time you get a Bad. The life bar starts full and it can be increased or decreased. Play continues as long as the life bar does not reach zero or it's game over.\n\nPop'n Music 3 features new songs and needs Pop'n Music 2 to work. An Append Disc is a disc that cannot be run on its own, and instead must be loaded through use of another disc (a Key Disc). In other words, you have to load the Key Disc first, then select a special load option (in that game), to be able to play the Append Disc.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"161976","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Music","Developer":"Konami Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd."},{"Name":"Gallop Racer 3","ReleaseDate":"1999-03-18T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Gallop Racer features 1400+ horses, 28 racetracks, and secrets to be unlocked. Three modes of play in which players can become a jockey or a spectator are included: Season, Practice, and Versus.\n\n\nBefore beginning a season users must first select from a number of options in order to create themselves. As a jockey players will need to name themselves, choose a gender, select a difficulty level, and design their uniform. Once the jockey setup is complete a horse will need to be purchased. While up to 10 horses can be owned at one time, some races will need to be won before a player can afford to purchase and maintain more than one horse.\n\nThe objective of Season mode is to become the best jockey which will require maintaining a stable of strong horses. Since game players can only own 10 horses at a time they may choose to sell or retire horses. Selling horses does, of course, earn money. However, selling a horse is not always the best route to take as retiring can eventually lead to breeding. If a player retires both a male and a female horse they can then breed their own original horse. The new horse's abilites will be a direct result of their parents' strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWhen entering a race a horse must meet specified requirements. Also, users will have to take into account their horse's current condition before entering a race. Horses can be in their best condition, too rested, or too exhausted. Each horse will be affected by the track conditions as well. Some horses run better on turf tracks while others prefer dirt.\n\nHorses that were bred during season mode can be used in Practice mode too. Here players can race on any track with any horse. Users do not have to control horses if they do not wish to. Instead they can set up a race and be a spectator. As spectators, two players can pit the horses they bred during Season mode against each other by importing horses off of memory cards.\n\nVersus mode pits players against each other in a three or five races. Users select the track and which horses will be entered in each race. Another option available is how the screen should be split. Players are given the choice of splitting the screen either vertically or horizontally. While racing against one another players also must compete with eight computer controlled horses. A point value is assigned to each rank so that after the predetermined number of races are run the player with the most points wins.\n\nGetting a top horse is important because Gallop Racer leaves little room for error. Each horse is rated in a number of categories: speed, stamina, guts, temper, breaking style, incline, track condition, and pace. Knowing exactly what the horse your riding on rates in each category is very important. For one, you don't want to enter a horse with a short amount of stamina into a long race. Another aspect, and probably the most important, is how to position the horse. Some horses prefer to run in the back of the pack until the very end while others prefer to take the lead right away and stay there. Season mode will keep players busy for a long time with its realistic level of play, large number of horses, and the ability breed.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"160377","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Tecmo","Publisher":"Tecmo"},{"Name":"Mushi no Idokoro","ReleaseDate":"1996-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Mushi no Idokoro is a puzzle game using insects in a fantasy world as the main character.

Returning from 1998's NFL GameDay 99 are the 3D polygonal graphics, commentary from Dick Enberg and Phil Simms, support for the Dual Shock Analog Controller and the option to create your own athletes. New features include multiple TV angles, a Play Editor, 200 motion-captured moves and 1,240 plays designed by 32 players from around the league.\n\nPhil Simms will expand his analysis and commentary duties with a telestrator, which means you'll be able to watch as key players are circled and lines are drawn on the screen to illustrate certain matchups. Both Simms and Enberg will offer the play-by-play throughout five game modes: Practice, Preseason, Season, Tournament and the new General Manager mode.\n\nPractice involves choosing formations and plays on either offense or defense as you work on your timing. You can also select custom plays designed from the Play Editor in order to determine their effectiveness before trying them out in a real game. Since there is no time limit in Practice mode, you can repeat each play as many times as you need.\n\nAfter working out the kinks in the Practice mode, players can compete against a rival team in a Preseason game. Options available before the kickoff include adjustable weather conditions, using modified rosters, changing the stadium, or having the game count toward your User Records profile. By turning the latter feature on, games played under your name will be recorded and saved to memory card.\n\nSeason mode lets you create players, perform trades (that may be rejected if deemed unfair), sign or release free agents, and enter a six-round draft to fill your roster with players at six positions: quarterbacks, receivers, running backs, linebackers, defensive linemen and defensive backs.\n\nPlayers who own NCAA GameBreaker 2000 will also be able to draft any of their college seniors already saved to memory card. Of course, if you would rather have the computer handle your draft, you are free to do so. Another new feature designed to offer you more control over team management is the salary cap. Each player is assigned a dollar value, so adding those expensive star athletes will cut into your available budget to field a team!\n\nThe 16-game Season mode has you playing as one team following the 1999 NFL schedule; win enough games and you will become eligible for the playoffs and possibly the Super Bowl. Statistics accumulated during a season can be saved to memory card (four blocks are required), and top performers may earn the right to compete in the Pro Bowl at the end of the year.\n\nFor those who can't get enough of playing through the Season mode, a General Manager mode is included to let you play consecutive years with the same team (similar to the Dynasty Mode first seen in Electronic Arts' NCAA Football 98).

It was later developed into several manga titles, five televised anime series, two three-episode original video animations (OVAs), and five movies. It also spawned several console role-playing games for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation, as well as one for the Super Famicom. Slayers is a Dungeons & Dragons inspired narrative that follows the adventures of the young sorceress Lina Inverse and her companions as they journey through their world. Using powerful magic and swordsmanship they battle overreaching wizards, demons seeking to destroy the world, dark lords, and the occasional hapless gang of bandits. The series is considered to be one of the most popular of the 1990s.\n\nSlayers Royal is a 1997 video game based on the Slayers franchise released for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation, featuring all the original anime cast, with the original voice actors.\n\nSlayers Royal is notable for bringing together Naga the Serpent (Lina Inverse's companion in the prequel OVA's) with Gourry Gabriev, Amelia and Zelgadis Greywords (Lina's companions in the TV series) for the first time. However, it is debatable whether or not the game's story stands as canon.\n\nThe game tells the adventures of Lina Inverse, Gourry GabrieffLina & Naga the Serpent. The adventure Mode itself has two components : Conversation and Roaming. In Conversations, simply use the button to go to the next screen of text, and use the D-pad to choose options.

It's summer and I think you're going to America for Christmas, but you'd love to get a woman before then. Enter you're three buddies Kousuke the jock, Tetsuya the DJ, and Taizo the... nerd. All of you vow to find a girlfriend before Christmas time and what do you know, there are quite a few suitable ladies in town. You yourself have been having weird dreams of some mystery girl and when a walk in the park leads you to find a girl that looks suspiciously like the one of your dreams, you find that maybe you do have chance with the ladies. But, let's face it. You have to juggle part time jobs, romance, and seeing your dude friends. Welcome to Refrain Love.\n\nWhile there are many females in the game, only three of them are really suitable love interests as I think only the three main girls have actual endings (which is a shame, since I liked the other girls more, like the chick who works at the office building, or the cafe keeper's daughter). And if you don't make a move on the girls then you're buddies will and you'll end up all alone. Ouch!\n\nThe game is broken up into Adventure mode and Simulation mode. Adventure mode is typical date-sim fare: go places, look for girls, talk to girls, choose the right thing to say, and then hopefully get some sort of CG picture. The simulation mode is where you have to go to work to raise your stats. If you have low stats, then you are prone to passing out and you have to go to the hospital. You decide where to go by clicking on houses on the map and the map is fairly large. Lots of places in town from the clubhouse where you DJ friends spins records, to the school campus, the video store, and the park. As well as all the apartment buildings where all your friends live.\n\nIn your room, you can choose to stay at home and raise your stats by watching TV, listen to music (which raises your \"sense\" stats), save the game, call people, or decide which part-time job to take on. Calling people is essential as that's how you set up dates. However, I could never figure out where to meet up with the girl or when. I've tried going to their apartments, but I guess that's not the way.\n\nAs for the jobs, I liked this part a bit. It's cute. The jobs change with the seasons. I was a lifeguard at the pool (got to meet many bikini girls), a baby sitter first for some little boy, then for a slightly older girl (oh my), the clerk at the video store, a construction worker, a host, an office building security guard and more. Working on the job allows you to meet all the various women associated with each work place. Plus they all do different things to your stats. Some raise your pride (like the security guard), while others lower your pride and raise your humor (host). All of them eat up at your stamina, so you have to go home and sleep sometimes in the morning to make sure you don't pass out.\n\nThe game features japanese voices for all the characters and once you beat the game you fully open omake mode, where you can listen to the music of the game, view CGs and character designs, and hear the voice actors talk about the characters.\n\nThe game features also different endings depending of the decissions that the player make during the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"162147","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Life Simulation","Developer":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","Publisher":"Riverhill Soft Inc."},{"Name":"Soul of the Samurai","ReleaseDate":"1999-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Claim your destiny as a proud warrior and honor your ancestors in Soul of the Samurai for Sony's PlayStation.\n\nIt's the end of the Edo Period in Old Japan and forces are plotting against the Shogunate.

Some parts of all these titles, such as the introduction look the same.\n\nThe signing in post is also the place where players and other interested parties can see progress and print off certificates. The first time the player signs in they will see a scene showing Christopher Robin leaving for school, \"I Wish I could go to school\" says Pooh sadly, \"Well why don't we have a school in the hundred acre wood\" replies Piglet. Owl says he thinks it's a splendid idea and claims it as his own. After this the player is presented with a map of the hundred acre wood which will be their starting point on future sessions. The activities shown on the map are;\n\nPrinting: Here the player can print name tags, book marks and worksheets etc\n\nMusical Mix & Match: The player is presented with two groups of instruments. They select one from the four on the left and one from the four on the right. These combine in the centre to make a new instrument which the player can play by clicking on the keys/strings. There are icons along the bottom of the screen to play a backing track - just one available, record, playback, save and play a saved tune\n\nNumber Balloons: Roo's game resembles a fairground side show, it has a striped roof and at the top of the screen running left to right are the numbers one to twenty - one number per stripe. Roo releases a random number of balloons and the player must click on each balloon once until all are counted, the balloons can be clicked in any order but all of them must be clicked. Then the player selects the number from the awning that corresponds to the number of balloons displayed. When the get the answer correct they can/must pop all the balloons and the process repeats\n\nThoughtful Place: Pooh is in the woods, he's at a place that's not quite a Thoughtful Place yet so making it one is the player's task. To achieve this they use the icons along the bottom of the screen one changes the sky, another changes the scenery, one changes the season, another adds music - just the one track, then items such as logs, trees, ponds, flowers can be added while another button makes any selected object larger or smaller. There are also icons to delete an object, wipe the whole scene, plus save/load icons\n\nTreasure Hunt: This gets the player familiar with maps and directions. On the right is a map with an overlaid grid, Tigger appears here usually somewhere near the middle. On the left is a smaller grid and beneath it is a compass, instructions appear in the small grid such as 'South to tree' and the player must click South on the compass to move Tigger around the map. This continues until he finds the treasure.\n\nWord Shop: Owls library was disturbed by a strong wind and he needs help to put pages back into his book. On the easy setting the player is shown a book with, say, a 'K' on the left and across the top of the screen will be three pictures one of which will have the word 'King' and the picture of a King on it. These match so the player clicks on the picture, drags it to the right hand page of the book and continues. On the harder settings the book will have a picture of a king and across the top of the screen will be three pages one of which will just bear the word 'King'\n\nShape Sorting: This is Rabbit's game and it is basically two shelves with an assortment of three shapes, on the easy setting each shape is a different colour, on the top and three bottles below. The object is to put the right shape into the right bottle. If the player clicks on the bottle they will hear 'This is a rectangle' or whatever is appropriate\n\nAll games have three difficulty settings and odd animations that pop up, apparently at random, to pique the player's interest.

The game is notable for its bright colors, upbeat songs, and cute character graphics. Although Pop'n Music was originally intended to be played by couples on dates, it has greatly escalated in difficulty since early iterations, and has since then attracted many players of beatmania and other Bemani games. Originally released in 1998, the game has had 15 home releases in Japan as well as many arcade versions.\n\nPop'n Music and Pop'n Music 2 were released on the PlayStation and the Dreamcast, and for both consoles two further append discs were released: Pop'n Music 3 and Pop'n Music 4. These later two versions required a \"key disc\", i.e. one had to already possess Pop'n Music 2. A special controller featuring the nine colored buttons of the arcade version of the game was released for both consoles.\n\nPop'n Music 5, Pop'n Music 6, Pop'n Music Animation Melody and Pop'n Music Disney Tunes were then released for the PlayStation, but there were no further releases on the Dreamcast. Pop'n Music 5 and 6 could be used as \"key discs\" to play the append discs mentioned above.\n\nUnlike most of the Bemani series, the Pop'n Music controller is not designed to represent any real musical instrument. Instead it is a pattern of nine buttons in two rows; four on top and five on the bottom. On the screen colored notes called pop-kun fall from the top to the bottom in nine rows corresponding to the buttons. When the notes reach the bottom the player presses the button and the game emits a note of the song, along with a judgement ranging from Great (hit the note perfectly on beat) (or Cool in expert mode.) to Bad (missed the note completely and breaks a combo).\n\nLike beatmania, there is a life bar with a long green section on the left and a short red section on the right. Getting Greats (Or Cool in Expert) raises the lifebar, while getting Bad lowers it. When it is completely full, a higher rating called 'Fever' replaces 'Great' until the lifebar drops again. A song is passed if the life bar is in the red section at the end, which lets the player play another song. If the song is failed, the game may give the player another chance of playing the game, but used up the first life. (Player can insert the credits during the time limit. This happened until Pop'n Music 13, where the use of second chance is free. Although the limit of lives is 2. But it does not give effect at Cho-Challenge, Expert, Osusume or Net-Taisen Mode. (or in the 2nd or final stage)) If the player fails the second time, the game ends. A player may play a maximum of 3 songs (4 songs in Expert Mode.) before the game is over. 100,000 points is the maximum amount of points that can be earned per song, and denotes getting all Greats (or Cools in Expert).\n\nPop'n Music is differentiated from beatmania by its lack of a turntable and by its hand-size buttons. Where beatmania is played by pressing buttons with one's fingers, Pop'n Music is played by hitting buttons with one's palms, fingers, and in some situations, arms and elbows.\n\nPlayers can choose from a 5-key mode (disabling the leftmost and rightmost buttons), or a 9-key mode. Older console versions also included 7-key mode, which made it easy to fully use a beatmania IIDX controller.\n\nTo make the gameplay more interesting, higher difficulty levels feature obstacles known as \"Ojamas\", large sprites which obscure the player's view of the descending pop-kuns.\n\nStarting at PM 5, Challenge mode, usually called \"standard\" mode allows the players to choose the normas or Optional objective that uses to boost the challenge points and it also uses by e-amusement after PM 14.\n\nA mode that was featured in Pop'n Music 6 is Expert or Nonstop mode, where the player chooses from different song lists or courses and plays through them in either Normal or Hyper mode. The lifebar is different in this mode. The life bar starts full, and then lowers every time you get a Bad. The life bar starts full and it can be increased or decreased. Play continues as long as the life bar does not reach zero or it's game over.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"161922","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Music","Developer":"KCE Yokohama","Publisher":"Konami Co., Ltd."},{"Name":"Fox Junction","ReleaseDate":"1998-04-29T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Fox Junction is a mecha action-adventure starring a red-haired boy who pilots a robot.

Though he never actually performed any of the wondrous deeds he so often boasted about, the king knighted him and appointed him as the head of the Royal Battalion. You see, the king liked stories, and truthful or not, Sir Daniel's stories were the best. Besides, Gallowmere hadn't seen a war in centuries...\n\nAfter years in exile, the evil magician Zarok returned to the land of Gallowmere with an unholy army in tow. In desperation, the king ordered Sir Daniel to lead his army against that of Zarok's. However, Sir Daniel's battle is short-lived, as the first arrow fired in battle fatally wounds him. The king's army manages to drive back the demon hordes, and to save face, the king declares that Sir Daniel Fortesque died an honorable death only moments after killing Zarok. One-hundred years later, Zarok returns, casting an evil spell over the land that turns all the villagers into beasts of unimaginable evil. In doing so, he also unwittingly raises Sir Daniel from the dead, who must now atone for his ignoble death and defeat the sorcerer.\n\nAs you traipse across the now cursed land of Gallowmere, you'll need to pick up life bottles and energy vials. The former acts as an extra life of sorts (refilling your energy bar when it is depleted), while the latter tops up your energy. To ensure that you don't lose too much of that vital energy, you'll acquire an arsenal of weapons including a crossbow, broadsword, axe and throwing daggers. Supplies for your weapons can be purchased from Merchant Gargoyles using treasure found on your travels.\n\nSir Daniel's task is a simple one, as he must navigate through each level and destroy any enemies and boss characters that get in his way.

Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters.

The player assumes the role of Gally and begins a journey that takes her from the streets of Scrap Iron Town and the desert outlands, to the city of Jeru and her birthplace on the planet Mars.\n\nThe game is set in 3D with the camera at ¾ perspective above and behind Gally, though at times the camera is a little too distant from her. This lets you take in a lot of the scenery but makes Gally look like a blue speck with legs. In each level there are story and boss rounds that have to be played to advance the game. At anytime however, Gally can leave the story via the world map and enter areas where she can fight opponents, for which she earns bounty chips to purchase weapons and items. Stay on a level for 40 minutes or 4 hours, the choice is yours to decide how fast you want to play through it, and how you would like to equip Gally.\n\nCombat in minor confrontations is initiated by pressing the \"Select\" button to switch into battle mode. This gives the option of avoiding opponents by running past them, or breaking off from a fight with no penalty if Gally is low on health. Bad camera angles, which are common in many games, rarely occur here. Gally is always at screen center and by default targets the opponent closest to her. Combat controls are intuitive and easy to master. Pressing a single button multiple times yields a combo; holding R1 adds momentum and changes the attack.\n\nGunnm Kasei no Kioku also packs a variety of options for you to decide how Gally will fight: barehanded, bladed weapons, missiles, bombs, TUNED Gun and plasma attacks (if her body is capable). If this sounds a little like overkill, well, it will all come into play. Battles of 2-5 opponents are common and Gally will face a wide assortment of tough guys, each with a particular strength and requiring a different strategy to beat. Some will throw knives or lace her with plasma, while others are tough as nails fighters that will surround Gally and pummel her if you are not careful. In addition, one level involves Motorball and requires a different set of skills to defeat opponents while racing at speeds of 300 km/h. If that is not enough, the boss rounds can be endurance slugfests, such as against Jashugan; or a shooter with Gally firing a gun loaded with collapser bullets into her nemesis Zapan. There is never a lack of things to do and the fighting never seems gratuitous or repetitive, but are integrated into the story and fitting for what Gally does best.\n\nThe presentation is so unique it seems it was made to complete the story Kishiro never had the chance to tell in his manga, due to an untimely illness.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"158273","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Beat 'em Up","Developer":"Yukito Products","Publisher":"Banpresto Co., ltd"},{"Name":"Star Gladiator Episode 1: Final Crusade","ReleaseDate":"1996-11-10T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Star Gladiator Episode I: Final Crusade is a 1996 weapon-based 3D fighting game released by Capcom for the PlayStation-based ZN-1 arcade hardware. It was Capcom's first polygonal fighting game, preceding the original Street Fighter EX (which Capcom co-produced Arika) by a few months. A PlayStation port was released on November 1996. It was followed by a single sequel, Plasma Sword, in 1999.\n\nStar Gladiator gives players the option of choosing 10 unique and personable characters, each with their own style of fighting and plasma weapon at their disposal. Moves are similar to executing fireballs and uppercuts in the Street Fighter series, and the game has many combos and super moves unique to each character.\n\nFighting arenas consist of a fixed platform that each player can be knocked off of for a ring-out. The environments are composed entirely in 3D, allowing players to step in and out of the foreground at will while battling each other. Also available is a Vs. mode for two player action, as well as a Team Battle mode where players choose a certain number of opponents per team and square off to see who the last man standing is. Characters are saved using one block of memory on the Playstation memory card.\n\nSTORY\nIn the year 2348, humans have been exploring space for the past four centuries, and have established contact with various alien civilizations. People now emigrate from one planet to another, and life is generally good. However, all of that changes when Dr. Edward Bilstein, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, uncovers the secret to humanity's \"sixth sense\" and discovers how to use it as an energy source he calls \"Plasma Power\". Within time, Bilstein develops ambitions of universal conquest and now seeks to conquer the entire galaxy in his own accord.\n\nAfter failed attempts to coerce other Plasma wielders to join him in taking over the Earth, Bilstein is captured by the authorities of the Earth Federation for his inhuman heinous crimes in experimenting on innocent people with his Plasma Power and he is imprisoned in a satellite orbiting Planet Zeta. Six years later, Bilstein has built himself a powerful cyborg body and managed to escape from his prison, gathering a cadre of Plasma mercenaries at his side.\n\nAfter making quick work of Zeta's defenses, Bilstein sets his eyes on Earth and hopes to conquer it in due time. A panicked Earth Federation has only one recourse: to find people who could utilize Plasma Power in their own accord and attempt to stop Bilstein in a last, desperate effort before the mad genius can invade Earth with his nascent Fourth Empire.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"13578","CommunityRating":"3.8333333333333335","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"T - Teen","CommunityRatingCount":"9","Genres":"Fighting","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom"},{"Name":"Jimmy Johnson's VR Football '98","ReleaseDate":"1997-10-10T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"As Interplay's first PlayStation football game under the VR Sports label, Jimmy Johnson's VR Football '98 offers both NFL and NFLPA licenses for real teams and players.

They are written by Yozaburo Kanari or Seimaru Amagi (depending on series) and illustrated by Fumiya Sato. In 1995, the manga won the Kodansha Manga Award for shonen.The collected stories are published in English by Tokyopop with the title The Kindaichi Case Files.\n\nKindaichi mysteries are whodunnit stories featuring (usually multiple) gruesome murders, often with a supernatural tinge. They are typically of the style of John Dickson Carr, and frequently feature a locked room mystery or other seemingly \"impossible\" crimes, such as a murder occurring when all surviving suspects have (apparently) airtight alibis.\n\nA notable distinction of The Kindaichi Case Files is that the killers are not depicted as psychopathic murderers and the murders are never committed for financial reasons alone. The identified killers all have deep rooted problems, often involving great emotional trauma through the greed or thoughtlessness of others, as their reasons for committing the murder(s). Thus the killers are often portrayed as sympathetic figures, as opposed to cold, calculating killers in some other mystery series.\n\nHajime Kindaichi High school student Hajime Kinda'ichi is unmotivated, lazy, and a little lecherous, much to the exasperation of childhood friend Miyuki Nanase. However, only a few people see his great intelligence and deductive prowess by his 180 IQ, possibly inherited from his grandfather, private detective Kosuke Kindaichi.\n\nMiyuki Nanase is the childhood friend and next door neighbour of \"Hajime-chan\"; many question why a model student like Miyuki is friends with a slacker like him. Deep down inside, Miyuki feels Hajime is not an idiot, and they seem to have a love that neither has yet fully expressed.\n\nKindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo 2 Jigoku Yuuen Satsujin Jiken is the second game for the Playstation console and used as the first one a mix between 2D graphics (for the characters) and 3D graphics (for the inside buildings part), featuring japanese voice acting for the game characters and beautiful anime sequences.\n\nIn this case Kindaichi & Mijuki were having a discussion when they found that the police had found a man hanged in a park, so Kindaichi offers his help and goes to investigate the theme park and that's when the game starts.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"159798","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Digital Frontier","Publisher":"Kodansha"},{"Name":"Street Fighter Collection","ReleaseDate":"1997-12-16T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Street Fighter Collection is a 1997 fighting game compilation released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn.

However, he is haunted by ghostly dreams that warn him of a great danger in Britannia. The Avatar decides to travel there once again. Upon his arrival, he witnesses the kidnapping of Baron Almric's daughter. Found guilty of the crime, the Avatar is thrown into the Great Stygian Abyss with the choice of either finding the girl or rotting in the dungeon. On his journey he will have to get along with the many inhabitants of the dungeon, who are survivors of a failed colony, and eventually find out that there's much more to this kidnapping than meets the eye.\n\nUltima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss is commonly considered the first role-playing game with fluid first-person movement in a real 3D environment. Unlike earlier first-person RPGs such as Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder, the player can move in every direction and the graphics are updated continually. The player is also able to look up and down with the press of a key, jump, and swim. The dungeon is not made entirely of corridors and rooms arranged in a rectangular fashion, but has a lot of variety: slopes, stairs, bridges, underground rivers, and more.\n\nThe game's combat system is action-oriented. The player has to draw his weapon, aim at his opponent, and hold the cursor over the game screen to inflict damage; the longer the player holds it, the stronger is the attack. Some weapons have different types of attacks, depending on where the cursor is held: for example, jabs are executed when the cursor is near the bottom of the screen, while slashes are performed with the cursor in the middle.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, the player chooses the gender, the class, and the initial skills for the Avatar. Skills include various weapon proficiencies, lockpicking, bartering, and others. They can be increased by reciting mantras at special shrines after having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points. Leveling up also increases the Avatar's hit points and mana. The magic system is based on runes that can be found in the Abyss. If combined in the right order, they produce a magical effect.\n\nAs the Abyss is populated by more than just monsters, there are various conversations the Avatar can conduct with non-playable characters. The player can also make choices regarding the Avatar's behavior towards these characters. Game progression is largely non-linear: the player is able to explore most of the Abyss in any order, though several specific tasks must be accomplished in order to complete the story. An auto-map displays all the locations the player has explored previously, and also allows the player to make notes on it.\n\nCHANGES FROM THE PC VERSION:\n- All the creatures and NPCs are now polygon models. Everything else, from the surroundings to the items, is still the original graphics, only slightly blurred.\n- The game is fullscreen, with only some indicators visible. The inventory is in a separate screen, which makes it less readily accessible.\n- The intro and endgame were completely redone. They also have more dialogue.\n- Numerous character portraits were changed to give them a more anime-like look.\n- All of the music was remixed. Most of it has a slight resemblance to the original music.\n- The PSX-port has many sound effects, while the original had no digital sound effects (apart from the voice acting).","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"163215","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Infinity Entertainment","Publisher":"Electronic Arts Victor"},{"Name":"Marble Master","ReleaseDate":"2002-07-10T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"\"Marbles with Attitude\" await gamers looking for logic, puzzle, and action-based gameplay in Elo Interactive's Marble Master.

This game was shipped in a modified Dance Dance Revolution cabinet, with the sensors and the game's art on it. Even though there is the presence of two sets of selection buttons (as Dance Dance Revolution supported two players), this game is one player only. To play the game, one needs to follow the on-screen instructor, and when a red light turns on located on top of the screen, the player must perform the move by repeating the instructor.\n\nThe specialized controller consists of a base station, which is plugged into the playstation, and four sensors, one for each hand and foot.\n\nThe base station should be plugged in to the player one slot. The round part should be pointed at thearea you are planning to play in. The controller works via IR so you should make sure that there isn't anything obstructing the base station from the sensors.

Loaded was released in late 1995–early 1996 (around New Year time) on both the PlayStation and Sega Saturn.\n\nThe game had origins in DC comics and more notably the more adult-orientated Vertigo Comics, and there was a small graphic novel based on the game. The six playable characters of the game are a combination of villains, anti-heroes, psychopaths, perverts, mutants, and flamboyant murderers. They are, however, the last hope to stop the intergalactic supervillain code-named F.U.B. and save the universe. The characters were created and designed with contributions from Garth Ennis of Vertigo Comics and Greg Staples of 2000AD.\n\nLess than a year after the original game was released, a sequel was released also for the PlayStation and the PC entitled Re-Loaded, developed and published by the same companies. It featured the same game engine, and even the game menus are the same, although it is a game engine with slightly improved graphics.\n\nFour characters from the original game are also in Re-Loaded, such as Mamma, Bounca, Butch, and Cap'n Hands. Vox, however, is not present in the game and is replaced by two new female characters: a pink-haired, cannibalistic sex symbol named the Consumer, and a malfunctioning android nun named Sister Magpie. Via cheat code, Sister Magpie can unlock hidden character Fwank from the previous game for use in Re-Loaded. If unlocked, Fwank is the best character in Re-Loaded, with the most speed and best armor.\n\nAll of the returning characters have new weapons and/or variations of their costumes. There are twelve blood-soaked new worlds to annihilate, much bigger than the levels encountered in the previous game, and with the added bonus of being able to morph the surrounding terrain with high-powered weaponry and explosives.\n\nSTORY:\nF.U.B., the antagonist of Loaded, had his body destroyed at the end of the previous game, although his brain fled in an escape pod. Landing on a harsh desert world, Kee-Butt-5, his brain has been implanted into the body of a chiselled, bronzed young artist hermit named Manuel Auto, and then he murdered the loyal surgeons responsible for giving him a new body. Reincarnated and renamed \"C.H.E.B.\", which stands for \"Charming Handsome Erudite Bastard\", the former raving lunatic supervillain has taken on some of the aspects of his host body, the creative, artistic and thoughtful Manuel Auto. With his matter manipulation powers, C.H.E.B. plans to transform whole planets into \"Works Of Art and Genuis\", starting with his own body which he grows to the size of a small moon. Once again the group of blood-thirsty anti-heroes gather to bring him down once and for all and set off for Kee-Butt-5...","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q01S-g18XFc","DatabaseID":"16784","CommunityRating":"3.3333333333333335","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"M - Mature","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Developer":"Gremlin Interactive","Publisher":"Interplay"},{"Name":"Simple 1500 Series: Hello Kitty Vol. 01: Hello Kitty Bowling","ReleaseDate":"2001-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"A lighthearted bowling simulation that serves as the first volume in D3's Hello Kitty Simple 1500 line of budget games.

Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits because slot machines were originally operated by a lever on the side of the machine (the one arm) instead of a button on the front panel, and because of their ability to leave the gamer penniless. Many modern machines still have a legacy lever in addition to the button.\n\nSlot machines include a currency detector that validates the coin or money inserted to play. The machine pays off based on patterns of symbols visible on the front of the machine when it stops. Modern computer technology has resulted in many variations on the slot machine concept. Slot machines are the most popular gambling method in casinos and constitute about 70 percent of the average casino's income. It is estimated that thirty percent or more of the profits from gambling machines come from problem gamblers.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"161774","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Casino","Developer":"Syscom Entertainment Inc.","Publisher":"Syscom Entertainment Inc."},{"Name":"Riot Stars","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-05T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Riot Stars takes place in the region of Roland, the player will control a group of characters during the game's story.

Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player's \"clown\" at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. \"Chains\" are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent's stack to descend faster.\n\nThe upward-dropping color-matching madcap Vs puzzle action is back, this time with somewhat richer colors, a more mature character art style, more playable characters, and a pseudo-RPG mode where you wander around a small world screen-by-screen in order to find and beat punks in magical drop battles, thus winning big drops with which to take over the world.\n\nMagical Drop F released in 1999, is the semi-sequel to the Neo Geo (and PS, Saturn, and NGPC) puzzle game Magical Drop III.

Including the early Kanadehon Chushingura, the story has been told in kabuki, bunraku, stage plays, films, novels, television shows and other media. With ten different television productions in the years 1997-2007 alone, the Chushingura ranks among the most familiar of all stories in Japan.\n\nThe historical basis for the narrative begins in 1701. The ruling shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi placed Asano Takumi-no-kami Naganori, the daimyo of Ako, in charge of a reception of envoys from the Imperial Court in Kyoto. He also appointed the protocol official (koke) Kira Kozuke-no-suke Yoshinaka to instruct Asano in the ceremonies. On the day of the reception, at Edo Castle, Asano drew his short sword and attempted to kill Kira. His reasons are not known, but many purport that insult was involved. For this, he was sentenced to commit seppuku, but Kira went without punishment. The shogunate confiscated Asano's lands (the Ako Domain) and dismissed the samurai who had served him, making them ronin.\n\nNearly two years later, Oishi Kuranosuke Yoshio, who had been a high-ranking samurai in the service of Asano, led a group of forty-six/forty-seven of the ronin (some discount the membership of one for various reasons.) They broke into Kira's mansion in Edo, captured and executed Kira, and laid his head at the grave of Asano. Then they turned themselves in to the authorities, and were sentenced to commit seppuku, which they all did on the same day that year. Oishi is the protagonist in most retellings of the fictionalized form of what became known as the Ako incident, or, in its fictionalized form, the Treasury of Loyal Retainers (Chushingura).\n\nIn 1822, the earliest known account of the Ako incident in the West was published in Isaac Titsingh's posthumous book, Illustrations of Japan.\n\nChushingura is a first person perspective adventure game released for the Playstation One console.\n\nThe gameplay is about talking to different characters in each screen to advance into next areas.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"160421","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Toei Animation Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Toei Animation Co., Ltd."},{"Name":"Breath of Fire IV","ReleaseDate":"2000-11-28T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Nina, the princess of Wyndia, and Cray, chieftain of the cat-like Woren tribe, are searching for Cray's relatives who disappeared under mysterious circumstances during a diplomatic mission.

While previous Jack games featured different categories, Mock 2 requires you to dig deep in your mind for everything associated with the theme that has been chosen. For example, one game featured questions about plastic - which brand of plastic was invented first, album titles from the Plastic Ono Band, and so on.

Throughout the planet of Arrakis (a desert-like planet riddled with dunes and sand), three military powers have engaged in a fierce war to control a most prized resource known as the Spice Melange. The mysterious spice can only be found on the planet of Arrakis; every race in the known universe lusts for its power.\n\nWith all the bickering and fighting over Spice Melange, the Emperor has issued a challenge that basically states whoever controls the substance will control Arrakis. The three aforementioned forces include the noble House Atreides, the wicked House Harkonnen, and the enigmatic House Ordos. Not only does each house desire control, they also have different reasons for entering the war.\n\nThe House Atreides loathes and fears the evil forces of the Harkonnen and wishes to form an alliance with the Fremen, strange sand-dwelling warriors that inhabit the bowels of the planet. The nobles function much like a normal army, giving commands for the side of good. On the other hand, House Harkonnen is run by a tyrannical baron that demands victory. These blood-drinking savages enjoy battles and chaos more than the actual victory; they reign with widespread fear. House Ordos is a bit more unorthodox than their warring brethren. Led by cyborg-like officers, they go into battle with a strategic mentality and play for the odds. Gut feelings aren't acceptable in their society. Having arrived with Lady Alara on the desertous Arrakis, she has enlisted you as a commander of one of the three military powers. Her sisterhood is hoping that you will be victorious with that house above all others, as to create a clear faction in control of the Spice Melange in which her Order could form an alliance.\n\nAfter selecting the house of your liking, a commander will give you a military briefing and objective. As a 3D real-time strategy game, you'll begin by constructing a series of battle units, important housing structures (walls, construction yards, barracks, outposts) and vehicles; this is vital in order to meet the mission objective. You'll start the scenario with a power supply for building a Spice Melange refinery to generate money. Afterwards, it's up to you to build a fully operational base. Upon completion of the necessary structures, it's time to attack your opposition! You'll command and control a wide variety of light infantry soldiers, troopers, saboteurs, and the aforementioned Fremen.\n\nDune 2000 also supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog movements and the vibration function. It also comes with mouse support. You can utilize any PlayStation memory card for saving game data and options.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6n931PYc5I","DatabaseID":"17889","CommunityRating":"4.6","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"T - Teen","CommunityRatingCount":"10","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Westwood Studios","Publisher":"Electronic Arts"},{"Name":"NCAA March Madness 99","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-30T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"The goal of every college basketball team is to get to the NCAA Tournament.

Like all its successors, the game is played through first person view in a dark and mysterious, medieval fantasy setting.\n\nThe game was developed by the Japanese video game company From Software, and released December 16, 1994 in Japan, making it the first RPG released for the PlayStation. Since it was never published outside Japan, this game is commonly known as King's Field (Japan) in the U.S. The game has later received a fan translation in English. A complete remake was released in 2000 as part of the Sword of Moonlight: King's Field Making Tool software suite for Windows PCs; also released only in Japan.\n\nSTORY:\nThere was a small country called Verdite surrounded by a deep forest, encircled by fog and whirling winds. In ancient days, when a great battle was fought and many were dying, Verdite was saved by a person who then disappeared into the forest. Only the forest's drifting fog knew who this person was... The citizens called their savior the Dragon of the Forest and built a sanctuary and honored this person there. Eventually, only a legend remained and the Sanctuary was changed into the Royal Graveyard and all was silent. But, the legend says, \"Someday the Dragon of the Forest shall return, bearing Magical Artifacts.\" However, the time has not yet come and the Sanctuary sleeps deeply...\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe original King's Field is the first of the first-person fantasy RPG King's Field series. It was released in Japan weeks after the launch of the PlayStation, and never localized or released elsewhere. When King's Field II was later released in the West, it was renamed King's Field for those regions.\n\nIn this game, the player controls John Alfred Forrester looking for his missing father inside lost, haunted ruins. The journey takes him through a five-level dungeon populated by friendly NPCs and deadly traps and monsters. The entire world, including objects, enemies, and the player's own equipment, is rendered with 3D textured polygons.\n\nThe player collects gold and items from slain enemies, and can purchase weapons and spells at two shops located within the dungeon. Weapons and magic are assigned to different buttons so the player can easily attack with both, however, recharging action bars for each prevent rapidly spamming attacks. Skills and stats increase with use, and items can be bought or collected that raise specific stats when used (green Verdite stones raise magic, for example). The final boss can only be defeated with magic, encouraging players to grind a rounded character to to a maximum level.\n\nEach level of the dungeon holds enemies more difficult than the last, as well as greater rewards. The game takes place entirely within the narrow walls of the dungeon, with the only \"safe\" areas on the first floor. Players can save their progress to the memory card by activating crosses mounted on walls throughout the levels.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"501","CommunityRating":"3.5","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"From Software","Publisher":"From Software"},{"Name":"Bust-A-Move 2: Arcade Edition","ReleaseDate":"1996-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Bub and Bob are back!

Vector must invade the computer Batinbo, and complete this final mission to revive humanity.\n\nNight Raid is a conversion of the 2001 vertical arcade shoot-em-up from Takumi, and has a similar feel to their earlier game Mars Matrix. Like in Mars Matrix, destroyed enemies release pickups, but rather than powering up your weapons they now affect your score multiplier. The multiplier is always slowly counting back to zero, but picking up the Score Items released by enemies will increase it. If a Score Item falls out the bottom of the screen, the multiplier is reduced, and can in fact go into negative, at which point the player will actually lose points for destroying enemies. The score can even go negative, and this is actually a viable method of play as the game will also track the lowest scores in addition to the highest ones.\n\nYou have a standard shot (upgradable through pickups), bombs (which can also be picked up), and an attack called the \"hagu launcher\" which makes your ship crash into enemy ships to destroy them, and must be recharged after use.

Having selected a character, players embark on a journey spanning 18 chapters, each of which is preceded by pertinent dialogue and FMV scenes, the former accompanied by character portraits from Yoshitaka Amano (best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series). The titular Kartia represents the lifeblood of the world of Rebus, as it is from this that almost anything can be created. Prior to and during each skirmish, Kartia can be used to fashion spells, equipment, and phantoms by assembling the various elements each entity requires.\n\nEverything created in the game comprises three elements: the necessary text, proper grammar and the Kartia on which to write it (three forms of Kartia exist, namely, Silk, Mithril, and WorldTree, each more powerful than the last), and it is these elements that are most sought after throughout the game. Phantom creatures, the foot soldiers of the piece, are aligned according to Common, Doll, and Shadow types, and analogous to the simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game, each fares better or worse against a one of the others. Although expendable in battle, phantoms will, like their human counterparts, gain in experience over time and increase in power and ability.\n\nThe battlefields on which players engage the enemy are susceptible to damage, and excessive spell use will scorch the land, burn trees to the ground, freeze bodies of water and deform the terrain.

It was later adapted into two anime series and five console role-playing games. Its title is a combination of words from two languages: the Italian word \"Popolo (people)\" and the French \"croix (crossing)\", which together mean \"crossing of people\". The general theme of the series is love and compassion, that the race to which one belongs isn't important and the importance of friendship.\n\nThe first game, \"Popolocrois Monogatari\", starts at the night of Pietro's (also called Pietoro) 10th birthday, when he learns that his mother, who he thought was long dead, was found in a coma. Pietro sets out into a journey along with the apprentice forest witch, Narcia, to save his mother's soul from the underworld. Pietro has to free her soul and defeat a menacing demon that is threatening to destroy the entire kingdom.\n\nThe game starts when Pietro, our hero, who looks a bit gloomy despite it being his tenth birthday goes to see his father, King Paulo, and after that the king goes into the tower that he has always told Pietro is forbidden, and Pietro decides to follow him. Inside, he finds King Paulo talking to an unconscious Sania, Pietro's mother whom he had thought died.\n\nPietro finds out that Sania's soul was taken to the Land of Darkness, a place where normally only the dead go, and that she has been asleep since shortly after he was born. Pietro decides he has to do something to help his mother, and despite King Paulo's wishes, sets off to see the forest witches who are researching a book that may be able to help the next day.\n\nPietro also grows older as the story goes on, so you are able to control Pietro when he is 10, 12 and 15 years old. Players guide the adventures of the young Prince Pietoro, whose mixed heritage puts him in a unique position to foster peace and understanding between humans and their traditional rivals, the Ryu. Pietoro sets out to rescue his mother from a curse and it joined by an assortment of powerful and magical friends along the way.\n\nPoPoLoCrois is played from an isometric perspective. Combat is tactical and turn-based, similar to that of a traditional strategy RPG. While playing you are able to pick up different characters to form a party, each with a different personality and combat style. Battles occur randomly and they become semi-strategic turn-based if you turn off the default auto combat option. Combat doesn't take you to a different screen, it just defines a spot in the background moving it to a diagonal grid, where you will move and fight the enemy. In these fights, there are many battle options, from special skills to tag-team attacks. Actions are based on an action gauge that fills up.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"98272","CommunityRating":"3.5","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"G-artists","Publisher":"SCEI"},{"Name":"Battle Stations","ReleaseDate":"1997-03-31T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Battlestations is a title where you take control of your own fleet, ranging from patrol boats and mine layers to battleships and aircraft carriers.

Players have about a month to spend with the sisters with each day broken up into three segments: first is the free time period before noon, followed by the period after lunch and ending with another period of time before bed. During day time, the player can choose which of the girls he wishes to escort to school, if any. The period after lunch is similar to the one in the morning, with additional choices which allow the player to go to various places in town besides walking home with one of the girls. Every night before bed, the player will be allowed to check his e-mail and send replies. As the player continues to interact with the sisters, their reactions to their big brother will change accordingly until the ending.\n\nAccording to one source, there are two different endings for each sister: the normal ending and the \"non-blood relation\" ending. As the name would suggest, the special ending reveals that the brother-character and sister aren't actually related by blood. In the case of some of the older sisters, this can lead to the protagonist and \"sister\" marrying one another.\n\nIn Sister Princess 1, the player can see two different endings for each sister, but Sister Princess 2 has four endings for each sister. The first two were the non-sibling relation and siblings-together ending and, if the player chooses one sister in the beginning but ends up with another sister, either of the other two endings for the first sister who the player does not choose appear (\"non-blood relation\" ending and \"still brother and sister forever\" ending also) but with a different story.\n\nSister Princess is one of the few popular dating game series that does not feature hentai elements. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, a rival company known as GIGA decided to create the hentai knockoff Colorful Kiss. While this game features a different cast of characters (to avoid lawsuits), their setup and personalities are comparable. Colorful Kiss was popular enough to warrant the sequel Colorful Heart. It is important to note that these GIGA titles are ultimately incestuous.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"162350","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure; Life Simulation","Developer":"Media Works Inc.","Publisher":"Media Works"},{"Name":"Hybrid","ReleaseDate":"2002-01-12T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Hybrid is a 3D first-person shooter with a futuristic high-tech theme.

It is arguably the most widely read historical novel in late imperial and modern China.\n\nThe Romance of the Three Kingdoms has been adapted into several comic versions in Japan, varying in levels of historical accuracy and loyalty to the original novel and popular tradition. Sangokushi (Japanese for \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\") by Yokoyama Mitsuteru (Ushio Shuppansha) and the adapted anime Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi.\n\nSangokushi Koumeiden is the second installment in the Sangokushi Eiketsuden tactical role-playing series developed by Koei.\n\nSTORY:\nThis release loosely describes the events of Zhuge Liang's life as depicted in Luo Guanzhong's historical dramatic novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. As Zhuge Liang, the player must assist Liu Bei in procuring the territories of Jingzhou and Yizhou and establishing the Shu Han kingdom. In addition, the player must organise Zhuge's Southern Campaign against the Nanman peoples and carry out the Northern Expeditions against the opposing kingdom of Cao Wei.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nUnlike its predecessor title, the player's skill and success for each battle are a major factor in determining how Sangokushi Koumeiden will end. In addition to having decisions at the beginnings of most stages that affect troop placements for both sides, event triggers, and the items found in armories and granaries, the game also tracks the player's overall record by monitoring the character's physical health and counting the amount of times the player has retreated from battle and restarted a level. Taking too many turns to reach a certain point in the story, or restarting battles too many times, will severely affect Zhuge's health and, if he becomes too weak, he will die before the decisive Battle of Wuzhang Plains takes place. However, if the player's skill is adequate, Zhuge Liang will feign death, luring his nemesis, Sima Yi, into the open. The game will then continue to the last chapter in a series of final battles against the kingdoms of Cao Wei and Sun Wu.\n\nAnother notable feature in this release is that Zhuge Liang's son, Zhuge Zhan, is a playable character in the final chapter of the game. The player is also able to choose throughout the third and fourth chapters how Zhuge Zhan's character statistics will be allocated whilst he is growing up. The player is then able to determine Zhuge Zhan's unit class before he becomes playable. The PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Game Boy Advance versions offer additional stages and minor storyline alterations.

The planet plays tricks on their minds, causing them to see illusions, including an illusion of the crew of the ship.\n\nA major theme of the game is Laika's different personalities, embodied by three different characters, Ernest, Yolanda, and Spacer. By talking to different characters, Laika absorbs their different colored auras and whena specific color has been absorbed enough, Laika can turn into that personality to solve a problem, such as needing Ernest, the strongest, to lift a heavy shutter.\n\nUnlike most RPG's, which feature turn-based battles, Planet Laika's are played out almost like Space Invaders and Pong. The player must bounce around a Mind Core and reflect back the enemies attacks to inflict damage. There are not a lot of battles in the game and enemies only attack when Laika is in one of the special forms.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"161884","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Quintet Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Enix"},{"Name":"007: The World Is Not Enough","ReleaseDate":"2000-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Bond's Best Missions!

With the official endorsing and license, the developers were able to include a lot of realistic elements from the racetrack into the game.\n\nAll of the top-rated CART drivers (circa 1996-1997) have been included and programmed to match their real-life abilities (based on a statistics standpoint). Al Unser Jr., Bobby Rahal, Gil de Ferran and many more are there to use or to race against. Each one has their own unique car, which can be tuned-up and modified any way you'd like\n\nModification comes in the way of tweaking a car's performance. If you know a lot about cars and how they handle, you can adjust their tires to fit the road (hard or soft) as well as modify their gear systems and aerodynamics. By moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings, you may be able to find a perfect combination for speed and performance. During races, a car's tire will wear down and it will eventually run out of fuel. Pit stops are necessary for a successful victory.\n\nIn addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included – each modeled after their real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, you've got the following options: Arcade, Simulation, Practice, Single Race, 10 Race Season. The season play is simply a series of races in which you must qualify and race for the cup and the arcade and simulation modes both keep track of individual racer statistics. If you're still getting used to an Analog Controller, you may want to make a few practice runs before starting a season.\n\nAdditionally, CART World Series supports two players via split-screen or a Link Cable.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"123321","CommunityRating":"4","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CART_World_Series","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Sony Computer Entertainment","Publisher":"Sony Computer Entertainment America"},{"Name":"Family Bowling","ReleaseDate":"1998-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Family Bowling is a bowling game that features 2 courts at the beginning of the game (Prism Town & Liberty Planet), 12 characters (only 4 are avaliable at the beginning of the game) & 2 game modes:\n- Free or Tournament mode: In this mode there are 4 possible playable characters to choose (Maki, Kazuhiko, Shota & Ichika).

The games that can be played in this product are:\nSeven In A Row: For four players. All cards are dealt and players take turns playing a card, the first player to play all their cards wins. Cards are played sequentially by suit and each suit starts with the seven and builds both up to the king and down to the ace. The game is played in levels, to progress to the next level the player must finish either first of second on a five round match. To complete level four the player must finish first.\nThe Rich Man: Players take it in turn to play a card, the card they play must be higher than the card played by the previous player. The first player to play all their cards wins. At the end of the first round the winning player is termed 'The Millionaire', the second player is 'Rich', the third player is 'Poor' and the fourth player is 'Destitute'. 'Destitute' must give their two best cards to 'The Millionaire', 'Poor' must give their best card to 'Rich'. Millionaire and 'Rich' must give cards to Destitute' and 'Poor' but they can give any cards they wish. Under certain conditions card strength is reversed which affects the game dramatically. Players start with twenty points and gain or lose points depending on how well they do, and they complete a level by finishing first in a ten round match.\nSplash: Players play card(s) to match the value of the card on the table, the first player to play all their cards wins. They win instantly (i.e. The 'Splash') if the total value of their hand matches the table card. The game is a variation on 'Crazy Eights' as it has similar special cards. Eight's change the suit of the next player's discard, Jack's cause the next player to miss a turn, Ten's reverse the order of play and Two's make the next player pick up two additional cards from the deck. To clear a level the player must finish in the top two of a ten round match.\nPage One: is another Crazy Eight variant. Players play card(s) to match the value of the card on the table, the first player to play all their cards wins. The special cards in this game are Eight's which change the suit of the next player's discard, Jack's which cause the next player to miss a turn, Queen's which reverse the order of play and Two's which make the next player pick up two additional cards from the deck. A further twist is that when a player holds just one card they must press triangle, if they don't they are required to pick an additional five cards from the deck. To clear a level the player must finish in the top two of a ten round match.\nSeven Bridges: Players are dealt cards and take turns exchanging one card from their hand with a card from the deck. When they have three cards of the same value or three cards of the same suit they can place them on the 'table'. Cards can also be added to sets and sequences laid by other players. The first person to dispose of all their cards wins. Players start with points and lose points for every card remaining their hand when a round is over. \nTo clear a level the player must finish in the top two after a ten round match. To complete level four they must finish top.\nOld Maid/Old Man: These are two variations on the same game. Old Maid is played with a fifty two card deck and one joker. Cards are discarded in pairs and the first person to dispose of all their cards wins. Old Man is played the same way but one card is removed from the fifty two card deck. In both games playing a Jack's causes the next player to miss a turn while Queen's reverse the order of play.\nSpeed: This game supports one or two players. It is not turn based, players play cards that are sequential to the table card as fast as they can. The first player to dispose of all their cards wins.\nPoker: This is Five Card Draw poker. Players start with credit and aim to win as much as possible, it plays like a video poker game of 'Jacks High'. This product does not use a memory card to store a player's progress but in Poker the player can press the SELECT button and the game will generate a password which they can use in future games to restore their credit. Pressing the START button swaps the player into the Blackjack game.\nBlackjack: This is a standard Blackjack game in which the player can generate passwords or swap into the Poker game as described above. The player's winnings are multiplied if they have special card combinations, for example 'Blackjack' - having the cards add up to twenty-one - multiplies the stake by five while a six card sequence adding up to twenty-one multiplies the stake by fifty. In both Poker and Blackjack when the player wins a hand they can choose to play a 'double or nothing' game such as 'Red or Black', Hi-Card select', Hi-Lo' etc\nConcentration: This is a game for one to four players. Forty cards are dealt face down and players take turns revealing a pair of cards looking for a matching pair.\nEach game has customisable rules, and adjustable AI strength.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"128929","CommunityRating":"5","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Board Game","Developer":"Bottom Up","Publisher":"Midas Interactive"},{"Name":"Madden NFL 99","ReleaseDate":"1998-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"As with all yearly updates to the football series, Madden NFL 99 features improved graphics and AI over its predecessors.

A selection of seven playable characters from the Rayman universe race to the finish line, overcoming obstacles and collecting power-ups along the way.\n\nRayman Rush is a on-foot racing game developed and published by Ubisoft, based on the Rayman universe. In many ways, it is like half of a port of Rayman Arena, featuring conversions of the same race tracks, the same introduction movie and also character theme songs (it, however, lacks the battles from M, and the character roster is different). It is a 1-2 player game, and each race has 2 characters running (1 in certain game modes). The game was released 4 months after Rayman M/Arena.\n\nRaces take place on 12 tracks in four worlds and there are five main modes of play: Training, Championship, Time Attack, Lum, and Target. Some of the modes of play in Rayman Rush concern more combative contests, as opposed to straightforward racing. Success allows players to unlock new characters and play modes. Two Rayman Rush players can race head-to-head, split-screen style.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nRayman Rush features 8 playable characters:\n\n* Rayman: The limbless main character of the game and series. He uses his hair as a helicopter to glide and likes to use his torso as a ball.\n\n* Globox: Rayman's best friend. He blows up like a balloon to glide. While he might appear a bit awkward and clumsy, his oversized body hides a definite dexterity and fighting spirit.\n\n* Globette : As shy as her husband Globox, she is yet a fierce competitor when it comes to racing. She blows up like a balloon and rotates her feet like a fan to glide, sort of like Globox.\n\n* Admiral Razorbeard: Previously the main villain in Rayman 2, Razorbeard is the admiral of the robot pirates. He is always angry, irritable and mean. What he lacks in size, he makes up for in spite. He rotates his arms as a helicopter to glide.\n\n* Henchman 800: One of Razorbeard's robot pirate lackeys. He glides using his built-in jet pack.\n\n* Tily: A slight, fragile and impish little fairy who likes to perform kicks. She uses her wings to glide.\n\n* Hunchman 1000: An older version of the robot pirates, which came before the Henchman 800. He glides using his built-in jet pack, like the 800.\n\n* Razorwife (called Mrs. Beard in the character menu): Razorbeard's wife, who has a more refined and fashionable appearance, though thinly revealing the same traits as her horrible husband, only worse. She rotates her arms as a helicopter to glide.\n\nGAMES MODES:\nThere are 5 game modes (only Championship Mode has multiplayer support):\n\n* Championship Mode: You will compete with a computer-controlled character (or a second human player if multiplayer is on). You have to finish 3 laps before your opponent to win. One victory in Championship Mode unlocks Lums Mode for the same track. With multiplayer, the screen is divided vertically.\n\n* Lums Mode: Only available once the corresponding level has been unlocked in Championship Mode.

One day, however, the powerful Gaia had had enough. Along with six disciples, Gaia exited heaven in an attempt to set things straight on Earthland -- or so he led his disciples to believe. Upon his dissension, Gaia became greedy for power, summoning an army of monsters to parade with him throughout the entire world and locking his disciples into one of the many new magical towers he had constructed.\n\nAfter his home, friends and parents were destroyed by Gaia's army, a 15-year-old human boy named Iros felt helpless. \"If only I had more power!\" he exclaimed in frustration. As though hearing his cries from heaven, a globe of light presented itself before the boy, bearing with it a magical pendant with the power to free one of Gaia's disciples. At last Iros had a chance to avenge his losses and free the rest of the world from the oppression of Gaia.\n\nIn Master of Monsters, it's up to you to assume Iros' role in choosing which disciple to free and lead an army of summoned monsters against the forces of Gaia. Among your choices are Necromancer, Summoner, Justice, Warlock, Fortuner, and Shadowmaster, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses, usually relating to fighting ability or magical powers.\n\nOnce your leader is chosen, your quest to destroy Gaia begins. On a hexagon-based battlefield, you have control over the monsters summoned (e.g., soldiers, magicians, neophytes, unicorns, rocs, elves, trolls, fairies, etc.) and their movement across the battlefield. The higher a leader's ruling power, the more monsters can be summoned. Positioning a warrior onto one of the many unoccupied or enemy-ruled magical towers can increase ruling power. After the leader of the opposing army has been defeated, you have won the battle and are one step closer to defeating Gaia.\n\nAs your warriors battle across the game's 13 types of terrain, they will gain experience points, leading to advancement in experience levels. After certain levels are achieved, the warrior can also graduate in class (e.g., a soldier becomes a knight). When at a monastery, two monsters can even fuse together to become another entity. However, this is not always a favorable action as the results can yield anything from a powerful dragon knight to a useless slime.\n\nDefeat Gaia and free Earthland.

It was then that the original Space Invaders hit the Arcades in full force, wrenching millions of quarters from gamers' pockets. Wave after wave of alien invaders descended from the heavens in precise rows, pouring missiles upon an all but helpless Earth. If it weren't for the experimental Tanks (originally called Laser Bases), which had been created by our xenophobic government years before, humanity would have fallen prey to these ominous galactic beings. Guided by the hands of skilled gamers across the nation, these tanks were instrumental in shooting the aliens out of the skies. Countless tank pilots lost their lives, but in the end, we won the battle and Earth returned to a state of (relative) normalcy.\n\nFlash forward 21 years and the aliens have returned. Just like those in the original Space Invaders, these aliens begin at the top of the playfield, march in rows from side to side and descend to the bottom of the screen. Beginning with Pluto, this new alien invasion is headed for Earth. Luckily, using the wreckage from the destroyed aliens from the original invasion, the government has been at work the last couple of decades on a new kind of tank. The new Tank was born complete with hover capability, multi-adaptive hard-points and an electromagnetic shielding system powered by a nuclear core.\n\nYour job in this updated-for-the-'90s version of Space Invaders is to maneuver the newly designed Tank horizontally along the bottom of the playfield and blast enemies out of the sky. Each time you destroy a wave of invaders, a new wave appears. Between stages (planets) you must face a giant boss. There are 13 enemy species and more than 100 levels, including hidden worlds and the original Space Invaders game. Scoring 50,000 will net you an extra tank. You can also earn extra tanks in the bonus stage.\n\nUnlike the original Space Invaders, which consisted of standard slide-and-shoot action (using a single type of missile), this game is loaded with power-ups. You can retrieve shields, double shots, timestops and energy boosts from the mother ship. Destroyed aliens provide vertical blasts, horizontal bursts, diagonal bursts, swarm missiles, fat lasers, boomerang bombs, acidic clouds and other powerful weaponry. The original game had bunkers for defense in every wave while this version offers blockades that appear in some levels.

Bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker (a.ka. Spider-Man) has super-human strength, the reflexes and agility of a spider, the ability to stick to walls and most other surfaces and Spider-Sense, which is an internal sensor that warns him of pending danger. He used his scientific skills to formulate a webbing substance, which he shoots from a device affixed to his wrists.\n\nIn this game, patterned closely after the comics, Peter Parker was attending a science exposition given by the now benevolent Dr. Otto Octavius (formerly known as Dr. Octopus) when all hell broke loose. Someone dressed in a Spider-Man costume stormed the building, took out the guards and stole the doctor's new technology. Now, the police and everyone in New York City assume the superhero is a thieving swine.\n\nAdding to the confusion is Eddie Brock, the human half of the symbiotic supervillain named Venom; his attendance at the exposition is baffling. As Spider-Man, you must get to the bottom of the mysterious happenings, clear your name and make New York City safe (relatively speaking) once again.\n\nYou control the arachnid superhero as he swings through the city, going in and on top of buildings and pummeling bad guys and other supervillians. Just like Spider-Man's comic book crusades, you can run, jump, punch, kick, stick to surfaces and shoot webs. Your webs enable you to swing through the city and yank, pull and trap enemies; you can also use the webbing to create spiked gloves, projectiles and a shield dome. Additionally, you can use combinations of punching, kicking and webbing for a more fierce and effective attack.\n\nMissions in Spider-Man include infiltrating a bank for a search-and-rescue, saving Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson's bacon from the deadly Scorpion, chasing Venom (who has kidnapped your girl) through the city and dodging bullets from well-intentioned police. You'll run across fellow superheroes such as Black Cat, Captain America and Daredevil and battle Marvel villains such as Mysterio, Rhino and Carnage. There are eight levels in all. Keep an eye out for the Fantastic Four headquarters, which shares the city skyline with such familiar structures as the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThroughout the game, you can pick up web and health cartridges and armor. Helper icons appear as aids for less experienced players. Walking into one of these will give you helpful information such as how to use your webbing and how to solve certain puzzles. You can also find special alternative costumes that will help you overcome difficult adversaries. A Spider-Compass positioned at the bottom right of the screen will help you find your way through certain sections of the various levels, and Spider-Sense, issued forth via vibration function on the controller, emits when danger is nearby.\n\nIf you're not ready for the demands of being a professional superhero, you can enter a Practice mode that offers the following training sessions: Time Attack, Survival Mode, Speed Training, Target Practice and Item Collection. In the standard game, you can choose from four skill levels -- Kid, Easy, Normal and Hard.\n\nSpider-Man includes a number of extras that you can unlock throughout the game such as the ability to watch mini-movies and view a character gallery. You can also collect comic book icons that reveal actual comic book covers in reference to historic events in Spider-Man's crime fighting career. Stan Lee, co-creator of Spider-Man, narrates the action, and Rino Romano, voice of the cartoon Spider-Man, reprises his vocal role as the wisecracking web-slinger.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"2955","CommunityRating":"4.1904761904761907","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"42","Genres":"Action; Platform","Developer":"Neversoft Entertainment","Publisher":"Activision"},{"Name":"PokeTan","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Poketan (aka Pokehito) is a communication / translation tool that comes with a PocketStation device and allows the player to watch english words and compare then with the japanese ones using the Pocketstation device.

The majority of the franchise is built around and focused on the various model kit series. The franchise has expanded from strictly motorized model kits to highly detailed and posable model kits, action figures and even PVC figurines. The various anime series, comics, manga books and video games all serve as tie-in media products for the franchise, to expand both consumer base and franchise recognition.\n\nZoids are fictional mechanical life-forms, found on the planet Zi. A Zoid is essentially a mechanical animal formed around a techno-organic 'core' (known as a \"Zoid Core\"), which serves as its heart and mind. The Core is considered to be 'alive', making the Zoid a living creature. Otherwise, its body is an artificial mechanical construct like any other mecha.\n\nBeginning fairly early after the start of the original Japanese Zoid releases, the battle story first introduced the conflict between two rival nations: the Helic Republic and Zenebas Empire. Their main weapons were Zoids, living war machines built from metal-based lifeforms native to planet Zi. The Zenebas Zoids were mostly red and silver and more armored, the Helic more skeletal and favoring blue and grey.\n\nThe Zoids revival in 1999 included both an anime and a new battle story. After decades of peace, the current Emperor died, leaving only the young Rudolph as his heir. His regent, Prozen, took the opportunity to resume the conflict between the Guylos Empire and the Republic. Early on, both sides used their past Zoids, the model line focusing entirely on reissues of popular past kits.\n\nZoids 2 - Helic Republic VS Guylos Empire (aka Zoids 2 - Herikku Kyouwakoku VS Gairosu Teikoku) is a PlayStation simulation game set in the Zoids universe. The game pits the Helic Republic against the Guylos Empire, using the popular Zoids toys/anime characters to battle out the conflict. Players move the more than 100 different Zoid units to try to beat the computer-controlled enemy forces. There is also a two-player versus mode where players pit their Zoids against each other.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"163328","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Will","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation"},{"Name":"Tiny Toon Adventures: The Great Beanstalk","ReleaseDate":"1998-10-27T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"In Tiny Toon Adventures: The Great Beanstalk, you play as the pint-sized cartoon star Plucky Duck.\n\nThe game is a wacky fairy-tale-gone-wrong, in which you explore eight different areas in a scavenger hunt based on nursery rhymes.\n\nWith Buster Bunny bouncing along at your side and Babs Bunny providing helpful clues, you attempt to make your way up the titular beanstalk.

Robots called \"Labors\" are employed in heavy construction work. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police has its own fleet of Patlabors to combat crimes and deal with accidents involving Labors. The story arcs usually revolve around Tokyo Metropolitan Police Special Vehicle Section 2, Division 2.

Noa loves her labor much like a pet and named it \"Alphonse\", a name previously held by a pet dog and a pet cat, respectively. She's somewhat impulsive, albeit not early as much as Ohta. Noa is arguably the best pilot in Division 2, although both Clancy and Kumagami have shown extreme talent as well but seldom pilot. She has a natural affinity for labors and gets 110% out of them, much to the amazement of her colleagues. Furthermore, she can drink quite a bit more than her co-workers, and recovers from hangovers much faster, since her family runs a liquor store.\n\nThe basic story is similar to the first movie in which a virus has infected the operating system of many labors (i.e. giant robots). Its your job as a new member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Special Vehicles Section 2 to stop the terrorist responsible and protect the citizenry (and cause as little damage as possible). The storyline is fully voice-acted by the original actors, a huge plus for fans of the series. The battles put you in control of the AV-98 Ingram-3 in the streets and underworld of Tokyo.

Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitanand Tsubohachi; the four members of the \"Heroes Team\", and Daddy; who commands the mysterious enemy character army. \n\nCalled the \"Heroes and Enemies\", they are all controlled by their master, and follow their predetermined (created?) fate. Today a battle to the end unfolds... \n\nGAMEPLAY: \nRakugaki Showtime you play as a rakugaki (scribble) character, who must fight against other rakugaki characters in a square 3D arena. The fights mainly consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple as \"pick up, aim & throw\". In Rakugaki Showtime different \"drives\" can be placed on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the direction towards the target will cause a \"Forward Drive Throw\", which is like a faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target will cause you to do a \"Backward Drive Throw\", which will cause your character to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage. \n\nBy performing a \"Counter\", you are able to block most items thrown at you. If your timing is off, the Item will just bounce off you and drop down. But if you \"Counter\" just before the item hits you, your character will perform a \"Donpisha Counter\" (Donpisha means to trigger immediately), which causes the item to be reflected back at the original thrower. \n\nOne of the more important items in the game is a Smiley Ball. Unlike all other items, Smiley Balls will not be destroyed after use. Instead, every impact will slowly make the Smiley Ball go from yellow to magenta, from happy to angry. After it gets very angry, a sound clip of \"halleluja\" will play and the Smiley will be engulfed in flashing white light... it has become a Super Smiley. When you pick up a Super Smiley, you will not throw it. Instead, your rakugaki will unleash their \"Super Smiley Attack\", which in most cases is devestating. Also, your fighter may be able to use different Super Smiley Attack's by applying different drives, these are called Forward Super Smileys and the Backward Drive Super Smileys. \n\nLike every other fighting game that has ever existed, you can execute Special Moves. These usually consist of very basic button commands involving the directional buttons and generally the Circle button. Some characters have a whole arsenal of Special Moves, others only have only a handful. \n\nAround the stages are \"Item Points\", these are where the God Hand will draw the Items to be used in battle. You can make your character move to these points quickly by performing a \"Homing Dash\". To do this, jump, hold the direction you want to go and then hit the jump button again. You will fly over to the point you indicated. As well as item points, you can use a \"Homing Dash\" to quickly fly over to Smiley Balls, this is EXTREMELY helpful. You are also able to \"Chain Homing Dashes\", to do this, just hold the jump button down after doing a Homing Dash, and tap the direction of another item point before you land. You can cancel Homing Dashes mid-flight by pressing the Circle Button. \n\nGAME MODES: \n- Normal Mode: In this mode, you battle enemies in set stages. The difficulty differs depending on your performance, where doing badly (i.e. losing two times in arow) nets you crappy characters (e.g. Zacko) whereas doing well rewards youwith really good characters. At first you will only be able to play as Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitan and Tsubohachi, but everytime you complete the game you will unlock another character. There are 12 stages you must battle through, ending with a final rumble against the God Hand. \n- Versus Mode: In versus mode, you can battle to other three players or computer rtvals. \n- Training Mode: Here you select a character to fight against a Zacko who has an absurd amount of life and hardly enough brain cells to fill a pore on the human face. This isgood to test out damage for the different moves of your character. The missions are as follows: 1) Use the Smiley Ball 2) Use Items 3) Test your skills. \n\nCHARACTERS: \n- Yukiwo: Yukiwo is the standard well-rounded protagonist. He has an above averageamount of health, at 3928 HP. His running speed is Fairly Fast, and his Homing Dash speed is pretty Average. \n- Sasami: Sasami is a very agile fighter.she's skilled in the Kung Fu Arts. Both her running and Homing Dash speeds are Fast, which will allow her to run rings against most of the opposition. She is fairly \"light-weight\" though, only having 2333 HP. She only has a couple of Special Moves, and they are all pretty weak. \n- Pitan: Pitan is a cute mischievous monk, who speaks in Kansai Ben.. He has 3001 HP, his running speed is Fast,and his Homing Dash speed is Fairly Fast. Apart from being speedy, Pitan's greatest advantage over the others are his highly useful Super Smiley Attacks. \n- Tsubohachi: Tsubohachi is Pitan's unruly drunk of a father. He is constantly referred to as \"OYAJI\", which is somewhat Japanese slang for \"My Old Man\", \"Geezer\", etc. Tsubohachi is one of the most enjoyable characters to play as. Whilst your controlling him, he won'tfollow your commands 100% correctly, which gives you the feeling of playing as a drunk. It's a brilliant touch to this character. Tsubohachi has a very decent amount of health, at 4802 HP, and his running and Homing Dash speed are both very random. Relying on whether your pushing against or with the way he's staggering.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"23756","CommunityRating":"3.7142857142857144","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Fighting","Developer":"Treasure","Publisher":"Enix"},{"Name":"Boxer's Road","ReleaseDate":"1995-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Boxer's Road is an early boxing simulation game by NEW, who would later be responsible for the Victorious Boxers series.

Shortly thereafter, the tribe laid witness to the deformed birth of their prophesied leader, born without a face, and fled Antarctica in fear of what the meteorite was capable of. In the present day, the ancient Polynesian city has been buried beneath snow and ice and RX Tech are excavating the site, investigating the meteorite.

Saiyuki: Journey West is based on one of the most famous Chinese folk tales; the journey of the monk Sanzo to India and back from his native land. Sanzo has the power to call forth powerful guardians to aid him in times of need, and as his quest progresses, so will the strength of his summoning. Along the way he encounters a whole host of characters and situations, and most of the allies he meets will have the peculiar power to mutate into monstrous were-creatures that possess enhanced powers.\n\nSaiyuki is a tactical/strategy RPG that centers around an adolescent named Sanzo or Genjo, depending on whether players should choose the character to be male or female. The main character was found in a basket floating down a river in a way not unlike the Holy Bible's Moses, then adopted by some monks in China. The story kicks off when a goddess named Lady Kannon appears to Sanzo/Genjo and tells him/her to deliver a thunder staff to a sacred temple in India. Kannon then provides a staff to to the hero, the monks bid him you farewell and good luck, and then players take off for a journey West.\n\nPlayers will journey as Sanzo or Genjo, taking on an expanding cast of characters to help win the day. The path through the game is very linear, comparable to Final Fantasy Tactics, and focuses on squad combat. All of the player-controlled characters aside from Sanzo have alternate were-forms they can slip in and out of at any given point in the fight. Yet finding the right time to alter one's form is the key to the battle, since transitions can take quite a bit out of the individual and can only occur once during a single combat.\n\nAlthough Saiyuki: Journey West does rely on skill management in relation to the were-forms and Sanzo's guardian magic, the complexities of similar tactical combat games have been put aside. But the key to this game is the fighting. Most time on the battlefield is spent attempting to correctly place troops in order to get a jump on your enemies. Each character is attuned to a certain element, as are the enemies. A good deal of the game's strategy comes in finding which element is more powerful against which, and then exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of the opponents' elemental stature.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"12396","CommunityRating":"2.9166666666666665","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"6","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Koei","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd."},{"Name":"No One Can Stop Mr. Domino","ReleaseDate":"1998-10-31T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"No One Can Stop Mr. Domino is a puzzle game which sees you controlling the titular Mr. Domino (or one of his friends, if you prefer) as he zips around levels which can be best described as a racetrack.

It was first released by Koei in 1988 for the PC-9801. So far the games remain in Japan and have not been localized. Ishin no Arashi's setting is the Bakumatsu.\n\nThe series's namesake alludes to the Meiji Restoration - sometimes abbreviated as \"The Restoration\" in Japanese, a chain of events to completely remove the shogunate and samurai society erected during the Warring States period and to restore the Emperor's influence. These events happen after the series's setting.\n\nPlayers predominately follow the Anti-Shogunate, Pro-Shogunate, or the proponents for opening the country throughout the tremulous time period; the depths of their perspectives vary on the title. It becomes progressively narrow by the third title.\n\nIshin no Arashi Bakumatsu Shishiden is the second game based in the NES Ishin no Arashi game, for the Playstation console\n\nThe game takes place in Bakumatsu times, that are the final years of the Edo period when the Tokugawa shogunate came to an end. It is characterized by major events occurring between 1853 and 1867 during which Japan ended its isolationist foreign policy known as sakoku and transitioned from a feudal shogunate to the Meiji government. The major ideological/political divide during this period was between the pro-imperialist ishin shishi (nationalist patriots) and the shogunate forces, including the elite Shinsengumi (newly selected corps) swordsmen.\n\nAlthough these two groups were the most visible powers, many other factions attempted to use the chaos of Bakumatsu to seize personal power. Furthermore there were two other main driving forces for dissent: first, growing resentment on the part of the tozama daimyo (or outside lords), and second, growing anti-western sentiment following the arrival of Matthew C. Perry. The first related to those lords who had fought against Tokugawa forces at the Battle of Sekigahara (in 1600) and had from that point on been excluded permanently from all powerful positions within the shogunate. The second was to be expressed in the phrase sonno joi, or \"revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\". The turning point of the Bakumatsu was during the Boshin War and the Battle of Toba-Fushimi when pro-shogunate forces were defeated.\n\nIn the game the player has to go around the town talking to different people to prepare the town defenses and also he will have to make trades, training, rest, go to the temples to pray, buy things, etc. The game is really heavy in japanese text and difficult to play.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"159757","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure; Strategy","Developer":"KOEI Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Koei Co., Ltd."},{"Name":"Junclassic C.C. & Rope Club","ReleaseDate":"1998-04-23T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Rope Club is a sister course of Jun Classic Country Club and was designed by Tadashi Sasaki under the supervision of Gene Sarazen.

People of extraordinary intellect, their pursuits were of the mind instead of conquering and fighting. They built a secret complex to train and practice their skills of logic and reason. Using technologies and ancient magic long since forgotten, they constructed devices of incredible ingenuity. Those who entered the domain of the Oracle and resolved all the tasks set before them went on to greatness.\n\nThose who failed... were lost forever. This structure, lost to the archeological record, has been sought for millennia but never found... until now. You, a supplicant who seeks admission to this lost city, must solve each puzzle laid down by the ancients in the 24 rooms of the domain. Guided by the Oracle, a jewel is rewarded for every success in resolving these tasks. When all the jewels are recovered and placed on the altar in the Oracle Room, the entrance to the lost civilization of the ancients will finally be revealed.\n\nThe game has 24 puzzles in total. Some are logic based and some are games of strategy. There is no time limit set for each puzzle. The Well Room acts as a central hub that directs the player as to which puzzles are available to be solved at any given time. The puzzles vary greatly in the level of difficulty. Some puzzles are extraordinarily hard.\n\nThe graphics for the puzzles are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style. Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off, if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle's well. There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where you begin the game. In each room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.\n\nThe puzzles in this game can be compared to those found in The 7th Guest.

If two characters from the same school were selected (with a few exceptions), single-player would play in a progressing story with fights predetermined beforehand and each fight preceding and ending with short 2D cut-scenes to explain the story. If two characters from different schools were chosen, the single-player mode would instead play similar to other fighting games, with the player's chosen team fighting against random teams of opponents before facing the boss. In the arcade, character selection was initially limited to selecting two characters from the same school and free selection of any character was accessed through time; the PlayStation versions, which included all characters unlocked by default, had no such restrictions.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLaWt3MNsjQ","DatabaseID":"26730","CommunityRating":"3.5","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Fighting","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom"},{"Name":"Retro Force","ReleaseDate":"1999-03-12T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"In Retro Force, you get to play as one of the four members of Retro Force, you can get to choose either Paris, Hawtin, Pi, or Sinclair whatever suits your skill, but they each have their own aerial attributes, with your chosen character, you then have to shoot down your enemies from the sky and from the ground, you'll get to earn points by shooting down the enemies.

It is also the 2nd in the 'Dark Savant trilogy'. It was published in 1992 by Sir-Tech Software, Inc. It was originally developed for DOS. In 1996 it was remade into Wizardry Gold, designed to work on Windows 95 and Macintosh, and distributed by Interplay.\n\nSTORY:\nCrusaders of the Dark Savant picks up where Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge left off. The party had just found the Cosmic Forge, the pen that the Cosmic Lords use to script the events of the universe, after it was stolen by the Bane King and his Wizard, Xorphitus. Before the party could decide what to do with it, it was spirited away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. The Cosmic Forge was used to hide the location of the Astral Dominae, a powerful artifact with power over life itself, on planet Guardia. Because of this, its theft revealed Planet Guardia to the universe. Now, multiple forces are converging on Lost Guardia to find this artifact, including the party itself. It is after planetfall on Guardia that the story begins.\n\nAs there are three endings to Bane of the Cosmic Forge, there are four beginnings to Crusaders of the Dark Savant (one for each of the endings from the previous game, and a fourth for parties who are starting fresh).\n\nThe first beginning follows a party who believed the lies of the Bane Queen and killed her husband, the Bane King, his lover, Rebecca, and her brother, Bela. On a whim, the party then enters the mouth of a \"giant slumbering beast\" (in actuality, a spaceship), which was secreted behind Bela's room, and takes off for the stars. The ship is captured in mid-flight by the Black Ship Dedaelis, which belongs to the Dark Savant, who is the main antagonist of the story. The party is then pressed into service by the Savant, who explains that he wants the Astral Dominae to overthrow the Cosmic Lords, and they are then transported down to Lost Guardia to aid the T'Rang in finding the Astral Dominae for the Savant.\n\nThe second beginning follows a party who did not believe the lies of the Bane Queen, and who spared the life of the Bane King. He commits suicide, and Rebecca gives the party the key to her brother Bela's room. In this case, Bela does not attack the party; in fact, the party agrees to accompany him on his spaceship to chase Aletheides to his destination. As Bela has been in contact with a race called the Umpani for some time on an interstellar communication device, the party transports to the surface of Guardia just outside Ukpyr, where the Umpani are based. They then have the option of joining up with the Imperial Umpani Federation in their mission to defeat the T'Rang.\n\nThe third beginning is not hinged on believing the Bane Queen or not; rather, it is dependent on whether or not the party decides to take the Cosmic Forge before boarding Bela's ship. Aletheides appears and takes the pen, and offers the party the opportunity to accompany him to Lost Guardia. After a long voyage, he transports the party to the surface of Guardia just outside Dionysceus, where the Dane live.\n\nThe fourth beginning for new parties describes the party as adventure and treasure seekers, who stumble upon the Cosmic Forge in an abandoned temple. Aletheides appears and introduces the events of Wizardry VI, then the party accompanies him to Lost Guardia. This party starts just outside of New City.\n\nWhatever the initial circumstances of the party's arrival on Guardia, they are free to make or break alliances as they see fit. For example, a party initially aligned with the Savant and the T'Rang are fully capable of turning on them, with no repercussions in finishing the game. In fact, it is possible to either befriend or make enemies of every nation on the planet, and still be able to complete the main quest.\n\nThe main plot involves the party's quest to find the resting place of the Astral Dominae, the greatest artifact ever created by the god Phoonzang. There are four distinct endings; each of these endings can then be imported as savegame files to Wizardry 8, the final chapter of the Dark Savant trilogy, which in turn has its own set of five beginnings.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"163243","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Locus","Publisher":"Sony"},{"Name":"Theme Aquarium","ReleaseDate":"1998-02-17T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Providing a home even Flipper would be proud to call his own this winter is the latest in the Theme series title from Electronic Arts, Theme Aquarium.

While the game's setting and opening sequence are based very heavily on the original film, the storyline is new and deals with the poignant social conflicts of the futuristic Earth from its own perspective. The game world is a land ruled by hyper-evolved apes in which human beings live like wild animals, without language or civility.\n\nPlayers take the role of Ulysses, the human hero of the game. As in the movie, the hero is an astronaut who is transported to the post-apocalyptic Earth when his ship crash-lands in the wilderness. Unlike Charlton Heston's Taylor in the film version of the story, Ulysses realizes fairly quickly exactly when and where he is. The game's most surprising revelations come from other discoveries that Ulysses makes as he proceeds through the adventure. The depth of the plot becomes more apparent as Ulysses discovers that many consider his presence on the planet to be the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, in which a human messiah would fall from the sky to save mankind from its collapsed state. For what it's worth, Ulysses does not feel very much like a messiah.\n\nGameplay follows conventions established by popular titles like Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid. The action is viewed from a third-person perspective, with the \"camera\" behind the hero's shoulders and panning occasionally to offer a better view in tight spots. While there is plenty of action and combat, the all-important storyline relies on character exploration and interaction for its progression. The game contains hundreds of lines of scripted dialog and Ulysses can have conversations with most non-player characters.\n\nOne of three \"modes\" determines how Ulysses will approach a given situation. In \"normal mode,\" the hero walks about at a regular pace. In \"athletic mode,\" he is ready for action, running from place to place and able to jump and dodge quickly. In \"stealth mode,\" Ulysses crouches down and moves as silently as possible, allowing him to explore hidden areas without being noticed by guards and other apes. All three modes of action are required to guide Ulysses safely through this diverse and dangerous Planet of the Apes.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"11594","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"T - Teen","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Developer":"Visiware","Publisher":"Ubi Soft"},{"Name":"Chrono Trigger","ReleaseDate":"1999-11-11T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Chrono Trigger is a Japanese-style role-playing game in which the player takes control of a party consisting of up to seven characters, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment.

Because of the acclaim, the powerhouse development company did the only thing possible -- a sequel.\n\nBefore detailing the follow-up, here's some background: the plot of the original game dealt with Eve, a woman transformed into a killing machine by a life form known as mitochondria. The infected woman/monster went on a bloody rampage through New York City, destroying anything and everyone in her path. Assuming the role of a young police officer named Aya Brea, it was in the players' hands to solve the murder case and thwart the vile creature; the awaking of her mitochondria gave her the clues and prowess to stop the madness of Eve.\n\nA few years have passed since the occurrences in New York. Aya Brea has joined the Federal Bureau of Investigations' Mitochondria Investigation and Suppression Team (M.I.S.T for short). After a series of strange incidents, the heroine is called into action and ordered to investigate the unfolding mystery once again. Human beings have begun transforming into hideous monsters known as Neo Mitochondrion Creatures; it is suspected that Eve is behind these bizarre events.\n\nWhile the look and feel of Parasite Eve II resembles the original, it features revamped character models with facial expressions and motion-captured animation, pre-rendered backgrounds, an overhauled battle system and full-motion video clips for storyline progression; the in-game dialogue is presented in written form with text boxes. Spanning dust-ridden ghost towns, elaborate laboratories and ancient dwellings, monsters roam about resulting in survival horror elements and scares galore!\n\nWhereas the original featured pseudo turn-based battles, the sequel's action sequences unfurl in real-time; you can dodge enemy attacks, run away or strategically decimate the opposition. Taking pieces from the sci-fi world, Aya Brea has been endowed with psychic powers and psionic spells including meditation, healing and offensive fire blasts in addition to conventional pistols and machine guns. Once the battle has finished, the heroine will receive two point awards: XP and BP. While XP points lean towards learning new spells (12 in all), BP points will have you customizing and buying weapons and items; enhancing weapons means purchasing or finding the right parts. Items include healing and effect-ridding canisters, different types of ammunition and important objects vital to the quest.\n\nAlong the way, Aya will come in contact with other characters including a bounty hunter named Kyle Madigan, a weapons expert named Gary Douglas and M.I.S.T agents Pierce Carradine and Rupert Broderick, all of which offer help and advice. Additionally, the various locations are laced with puzzles ranging from finding certain key cards to solving riddles and manipulating gears and pictures for the sake of progress.\n\nA single-player experience, Parasite Eve II offers three different endings (depending on how well you do) and supports PlayStation memory cards for saving game data and the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog controls and the vibration function.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APHrYEeXMhQ","DatabaseID":"9332","CommunityRating":"4.5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_Eve_II","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"M - Mature","CommunityRatingCount":"34","Genres":"Horror; Role-Playing","Developer":"Squaresoft","Publisher":"Squaresoft"},{"Name":"Blaze and Blade: Eternal Quest","ReleaseDate":"1998-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Adventurers come across an ancient lithograph during their travels, supposedly very valuable, and desire to verify the authenticity of this artifact.

The majority of the franchise is built around and focused on the various model kit series. The franchise has expanded from strictly motorized model kits to highly detailed and posable model kits, action figures and even PVC figurines. The various anime series, comics, manga books and video games all serve as tie-in media products for the franchise, to expand both consumer base and franchise recognition.\n\nZoids are fictional mechanical life-forms, found on the planet Zi. A Zoid is essentially a mechanical animal formed around a techno-organic 'core' (known as a \"Zoid Core\"), which serves as its heart and mind. The Core is considered to be 'alive', making the Zoid a living creature. Otherwise, its body is an artificial mechanical construct like any other mecha.\n\nBeginning fairly early after the start of the original Japanese Zoid releases, the battle story first introduced the conflict between two rival nations: the Helic Republic and Zenebas Empire. Their main weapons were Zoids, living war machines built from metal-based lifeforms native to planet Zi. The Zenebas Zoids were mostly red and silver and more armored, the Helic more skeletal and favoring blue and grey.\n\nZoids - Battle Card Game - Seihou Tairiku Senki it's a tactic RPG for the PlayStation system, the gameplay is like a table board game, you can combine the units with a card deck that includes weapons, situations, equipment, ammo, pilots, etc.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"163329","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Tomy Corporation","Publisher":"Tomy Corporation"},{"Name":"Hai-Shin 2","ReleaseDate":"1998-03-26T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Hai-Shin 2 is the sequel to the Playstation game Pro Logic Mahjong Hai Shin and is also mahjong game with different game modes:\n- Special Play (free mode)\n- Mahjong Grand Prix (story mode: Mahjong championship of 1998)\n- Basic Study (Mahjong guide & dictionary)\n- Mahjong Hands (practical tutorial)\n- Tempai Mahjong (play tempai mahjong with his guide)","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"158272","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Board Game","Developer":"Warashi","Publisher":"Aques"},{"Name":"Mezase!

It was released on PlayStation exclusively within Europe, and localised for France, the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy. The game is a tie-in for the 1999 comic book film Virus.[1]\n\nThe game is generally poorly regarded and has since fallen into obscurity.\n\nThe game is a survival-horror action title, similar to the popular PlayStation games Resident Evil and Tomb Raider. The player guides the character, Joan, from a third-person viewpoint (by default the camera is placed behind Joan, but it is adjustable), through eleven levels in which she confronts forty types of hostile creatures, including five bosses, using nine different weapons.[2]\n\nSpecial passwords can be used to access levels without playing all the way up to them.\n\nLoosely based on the film (and in turn, the comic book), the game is about an alien electrical life-form (usually referred to as \"the Evil\") which hijacks a space station, beams itself down to a ship called The Electra and plans to take over the world. To do so, it killed the ship crew and outfitted them with implants to infiltrate the human race. Unlike in the film, the ship makes it to port and the cyborg monsters infest the \"Nakomi hotel\". A female police officer and specialist in criminology, Joan Averil, is sent in to investigate \"strange events\" along with her partner Sutter. They discover the monsters, and fight their way through, rescuing two civilians on the way. Yakuza criminals also appear as enemies on the way. As reports of strange activity on The Electra surfaces, they track the infestation down to the ship and board it. Joan reveals that her brother Thomas works on the ship, and hopes to find him. They do, but Sutter is killed. They eventually manage to blow up the ship and escape. The ending cinematic ominously zooms out to depict the infested space station.\n\nThe back insert blurb of the game states \"The virus has arrived on earth to destroy the human race.

In Asia, mahjong is also popularly played as a gambling game. In the game, each player is dealt either thirteen or sixteen tiles in a hand, depending on the variation being played. On their turn, players draw a tile and discard one, with the goal of making four or five melds (also depending on the variation) and one pair, or \"head\". Winning comes \"on the draw\" by drawing a new or discarded tile that completes the hand. Thus, a winning hand actually contains fourteen (or seventeen) tiles.\n\nHanafuda are playing cards of Japanese origin, used to play a number of games. The name literally translates as 'flower cards'.\n\nThere are twelve suits, representing months. Each is designated a flower, and each suit has four cards. Typically, there are two 'normal' cards worth one point, one poetry ribbon card worth five points, and a final special card worth ten or twenty points. The point values could be considered unnecessary and arbitrary, as the most popular games only concern themselves with certain combinations of taken cards.\n\nMa-Jyan de Pon! Hanahuda de Koi!

The subtitle of this game is Daughter of Kingdom. The games starts out in town where your first task is to rescue the daughter of the king (thus the subtitle, ''Daughter of Kingdom'') and get her to join you. After you rescue the king's daughter, you'll set out to find 2 more companions to bring your party up to the standard 4 people. The main character in the game is a white haired princess who has to keep her father's kingdom together through adventure, interaction and lots of fighting.\n\nThe in-game movement is reminescent of Might & Magic and Bards Tale (these are two very old Commodore 64 and PC games) with the sides of walls scrolling past you as walk through towns and wilderness. Boundary Gate improves on this generic 'maze engine' by adding 360 degree panning and wide open spaces to explore. There are many doors in cities that you can enter to encounter the various characters in the game. For example, when you enter an inn, the owner will greet you and ask if you wish to stay the night. In a nice touch, subtle animation is apparent in all of the characters that you encounter. The innkeeper will move his arms and act jovial as he questions you.\n\nThe voluminous fighting in the game is viewed from a behind your character perspective. As you hack, slash and cast magical spells, the screen will light up with sparks and luminescence from your magic.\n\nIf it looks like every other monster that you meet is bigger, stronger and mightier than you are, then you'd be correct. There are a lot of tough beasts in Boundary Gate that you'll encounter in towns (yes, in populated towns) and the surrounding countryside that will give you pause. Since the battles are fought in real time with each slash, stroke and blow animated in good detail, adventurers will have to make their decisions efficiently. A good tactic to use in Boundary Gate is to build up your party as quickly as possible by defeating some lesser monsters. You should then outfit your guys with the best armor that you can afford with the gold that you score for better protection against the tougher beasts.\n\nSTORY:\nLong time ago, the First Mother created the world and blessed it with five magical symbols that would keep it in balance. The symbols were hidden deep in a sacred temple, to protect everything and everyone around them.\n\nMany years later, an adventurer named Finn was looking for work in the city of Ambrose. There was indeed much work to do: monsters roamed the country, the threat of war was more real than ever. One night Finn was strolling through the city when he suddenly spotted a young girl attacked by a monster. Naturally, he defeated the monster and saved the girl, who turned out to be a princess hoping to restore her father's kingdom. The two decide to work together and venture to the nearby city, that lies in ruins, overrun by monsters...\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nBoundary Gate is an old-fashioned RPG with dungeon-like 3D layout. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, with the exception of battles, where the heroes can be seen from an \"over-the-shoulder\" view. The attacks are animated. Enemies are random, and combat is turn-based, the party members using equipped weapons to attack or magical spells. Important locations are presented as 2D pictures. There is also voice acting for important conversations.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"143556","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Victor Interactive Software","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software"},{"Name":"Block Kuzushi 2","ReleaseDate":"2000-02-03T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Block Kuzushi 2 is a good breakout game that can be played by 2 players in cooperative or VS mode.

It is related to bowls, boule and shuffleboard. Two teams, each of four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called \"rocks\", across the ice curling sheet towards the house, a circular target marked on the ice. Each team has eight stones. The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end, which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones. A game may consist of ten or eight ends. \n\nThe curler can induce a curved path by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides, and the path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms who accompany it as it slides down the sheet, using the brooms to alter the state of the ice in front of the stone. A great deal of strategy and teamwork goes into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation, and the skills of the curlers determine how close to the desired result the stone will achieve. This gives curling its nickname of \"Chess On Ice\". \n\nThe Curling (Superlite 1500 Series) is a 2d curling game that features 6 selectable characters & 2 game modes: \n- 1 Player vs Computer \n- 1 Player vs 2 Player","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"165982","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Sucess","Publisher":"Sucess"},{"Name":"Simple 1500 Series Vol. 16: The Pachislot","ReleaseDate":"1999-11-19T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Simple 1500 Series vol.016 The Pachi-Slot features 4 different slot machines.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"132310","Platform":"Sony Playstation","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Casino","Developer":"D3 Publisher","Publisher":"D3 Publisher"},{"Name":"World Pro Tennis '98","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"145731","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},{"Name":"Roland Garros French Open 2001","ReleaseDate":"2001-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The French Open is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June in Paris, France, at the Stade Roland Garros.

Day and night he sits in front of his GameStation and plays a game called Moon: a typical Japanese RPG with a sword-wielding hero who kills monster after monster on his grand epic quest. Skipping through the boring, cliche story, the boy continues to play until his mother tells him to stop and go to bed. However, the TV on which he was just playing the game miraculously turns itself on, and the boy is sucked into the world of Moon, a fantasy land called Love-de-Gard. \n\nIt turns out that the hero of the game that the boy was playing is a troublesome individual, who does nothing else but slaughter various creatures populating the land, barge into people's houses bothering them with questions and taking their possessions without asking, and complain that he \"can't reach the final dungeon\". Souls of the animals the hero has killed find no rest, and the land's inhabitants are horrified. The boy realizes that there can only be one answer to that: love.\n\nMoon: Remix RPG Adventure is an adventure game with light role-playing elements that parodies the RPG genre by presenting a situation in which the player character must act in a way opposite to the usual behavior of typical RPG protagonists. There is no combat in the game. Core gameplay resembles that of adventure games: the player explores various locations, talks to characters and solves problems in a non-violent way. The game's world is open-ended, and story progression is non-linear. The world has a day and night cycle as well as an internal calendar, with people following their own schedules daily. \n\nThe main goal consists of raising the protagonist's \"love level\", which is achieved by fulfilling people's wishes. In many cases it is not immediately obvious what people really wish for, and the player has to gather clues and learn more about the game world's inhabitants in order to find a way to make a particular character happy. Some of these activities are timed. Soul-catching, i.e. resurrecting the animals killed by the hero of the game Moon, is one of the ways to increase the love level. Amassing love points raises the \"action limit\", which is the amount of time the boy can stay in Love-de-Gard. If the action limit falls to zero, the game is over.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"129051","CommunityRating":"4.5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon:_Remix_RPG_Adventure","Platform":"Sony Playstation","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Love-de-Lic","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation"},{"Name":"ESPN MLS Gamenight","ReleaseDate":"2000-09-19T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Quality graphics and animations heighten the realism as you play through the game's many modes, including training, exhibition games, season play, and cup finals.

Each character has their own unique wardrobe and dancing style; Hiro is patterned after John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever and Frida is a funky 17-year-old artist that likes to get her groove on.\n\nGameplay options include One-Player, Two-Player, Dance View, and Practice modes. In the One-Player game, the idea is to out-dance your opponents by executing moves in time to the beat. Using a dance command system reminiscent of PaRappa the Rappa, players will press button combinations in conjunction to the icons displayed on the screen. The better you do, the more the camera focuses on your character; the idea is to have the camera completely on you by the end of the song.\n\nAdditionally, there is an Enthusiasm Gauge that measures how much the crowd is into your dancing. By executing tricky maneuvers, it will skyrocket, but if the moves aren't in synch with the rhythm, you'll get booed and the gauge will drop. Players are given the opportunity to execute either easy moves (located at the top of the screen) or harder moves (at the bottom), which also affects the Enthusiasm Gauge.\n\nThe Practice mode teaches new players all the basics of how to execute simple maneuvers and the harder combinations and dance solos. When you feel confident enough, challenge your friend to a no-frills dance-off with the Two-Player option. Each player selects a character and enters a heated battle for the king or queen of the dance floor.\n\nOnce you've cleared some of the One-Player scenarios, the Dance View option becomes available. This option gives those armchair dance choreographers a chance to program a character's dance moves. Players can pan the camera, zoom in at specific times, change routes, increase the speed, and perform other tweaks.

The player controls a wizard attempting to rule two worlds. From a small settlement, the player must grow an empire and banish all the other wizards by military might or casting the Spell of Mastery. To do this, the player must manage resources, build cities and armies, and research spells. Master of Magic's early versions had many bugs, and was heavily criticized by reviewers.\n\nThe game Master of Magic takes place across two worlds of existence, Arcanus and Myrror. Arcanus is a land much like our Earth, with arctic poles, and terrain consisting of forests, oceans, grasslands, and deserts. Myrror is a parallel world to Arcanus, with a heavier magical atmosphere, fantastic flora and fauna not found on Arcanus. The two worlds are physically linked to each other by special Towers of Wizardry, allowing units to travel between them. The concept is akin to two floors of a building linked by stairwells.\n\nIn line with the theme of magic in the game, magic nodes - which are sources of magical power - are scattered throughout the two worlds.
